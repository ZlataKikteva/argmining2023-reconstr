switching from something that is done by the community to the community is a transformation the consequence of switching from something that is done by the community to the community is more likely to be resistance than people going along with it,"in general in life, as far as you can, you should reason and argue and debate with people rather than imposing something on them",inference
if Robin Shattock measured AudienceMember 20220210QT35's today and said it was below a protective threshold that would or would not persuade them to get vaccinated measuring their antibody levels could persuade AudienceMember 20220210QT35 to get vaccinated,AudienceMember 20220210QT35 wanted to get their antibody levels measured,inference
"Robin Shattock can tell you all the evidence shows the vaccine is completely safe your risk from the vaccine, and the risk from the vaccine is so low to you, and the benefits are so high that it would boost your immune response","the vaccine would give you the security that those vulnerable members of your family who you have persuaded to get vaccines for very real reasons, you are not going to be passing on the virus to them",inference

the government not being honest makes us people who are suffering and doing our absolute best in circumstances where we can't help with we deserve an honest acknowledgment of the leadership failing us,you feel the leadership has failed us,inference
it took weeks and weeks after that for the government to then start to actually ramp up testing to the level that it needed to be at Nick Thomas-Symonds is afraid that hitting the target on 30th of April was done by putting a number of tests in the post without actual guarantee that those tests had been used,the Government testing has not got to the correct level yet,inference

the information commissioner was not consulted on this app the information commissioner not being consulted potentially fails the NHS app standards for data protection,xxx are what assurances the government can give us in the data protection standards,inference
Afua Hirsch's understanding is once you sign up to the app there is not a lot of data otherwise it won't work,as soon as you develop symptoms of Coronavirus you have to have that data on a database,inference
people who got an alert on their phone should self-isolate initially people who got an alert on their phone don't have symptoms,people who got an alert on their phone wouldn't need to isolate for longer than that,inference
testing along with using the app is an option to work out precisely how this would work,this is why we are piloting it,inference

the NHS will need to know very quickly what they are meant to be doing George Eustice doesn't seem to be clear how the app works,people need to know how the app works,inference
the government keeps getting distracted by the wrong things the government were too consumed about models and herd immunity,we were talking about why the government didn't have tests in place earlier,inference
we are not entirely clear how the app works we are not sure how the app is going to work,the app is being tried in the Isle of Wight,inference
two weeks is being suggested this is something that may be coming the way of all of us,let's understand how it works to be clear,inference
we don't know yet we don't know,the lack of clarity on procedure is why the Government are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,inference

"one of the major issues that concerns many viewers that will download the mobile app is our reluctance for the government to access our private data and all the privacy issues of using such data for track, trace and quarantine then the authorities can track if we have caught the virus to pinpoint where we have been and whom we have had contact with",to be a success it is essential that the authorities have access to our personal data,inference
all these discussions about comparisons and we are not sure Britain has a lot of capability,"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like Britain, with all of its capability, should have done better",inference
until the government shows some integrity we can't begin to see how we can move forward what AudienceMember 20220224QT01 said in her question is we didn't plan ahead,AudienceMember 20220224QT01's question is absolutely spot on,inference
Afua Hirsch has not seen any conversation about which liberties we are giving away happen yet we need this app and to be able to track and trace,we absolutely need the track and trace technology,inference

one of the advantages of the NHS app we have been developing is people can trust it as part of the NHS unlike some of those other apps you get better information about where you might get local flare ups,we are able to respond to flare ups and monitor local or regional pick up in the virus,inference
the privacy issue of the track and trace app has to go out the window we have to see this as what it is,we have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we have to see this as what it is we have all made too many sacrifices,we have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference

this is where trust comes in the Government had been honest with us and taken all these concerns seriously from the beginning,it would be a lot easier to listen to proposed guidelines about returning to work,inference
You need to have flexibility for employers to do what works in their environment there will always be employers who are not responsible and willing to put their workers at risk,we need a bit of reality,inference
"we are going through complications when we have talked to our staff about what might happen, things they immediately raised were what is it going to be like travelling into the central part of the city and being on a packed tube train and next to people that might present a safety risk",an example of the complocations is we work in the centre of London,inference
