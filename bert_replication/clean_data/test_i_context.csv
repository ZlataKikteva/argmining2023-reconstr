switching from something that is done by the community to the community is a transformation the consequence of switching from something that is done by the community to the community is more likely to be resistance than people going along with it,"in general in life, as far as you can, you should reason and argue and debate with people rather than imposing something on them",inference
if Robin Shattock measured AudienceMember 20220210QT35's today and said it was below a protective threshold that would or would not persuade them to get vaccinated measuring their antibody levels could persuade AudienceMember 20220210QT35 to get vaccinated,AudienceMember 20220210QT35 wanted to get their antibody levels measured,inference
"Robin Shattock can tell you all the evidence shows the vaccine is completely safe your risk from the vaccine, and the risk from the vaccine is so low to you, and the benefits are so high that it would boost your immune response","the vaccine would give you the security that those vulnerable members of your family who you have persuaded to get vaccines for very real reasons, you are not going to be passing on the virus to them",inference

the information commissioner was not consulted on this app the information commissioner not being consulted potentially fails the NHS app standards for data protection,xxx are what assurances the government can give us in the data protection standards,inference
Afua Hirsch's understanding is once you sign up to the app there is not a lot of data otherwise it won't work,as soon as you develop symptoms of Coronavirus you have to have that data on a database,inference
people who got an alert on their phone should self-isolate initially people who got an alert on their phone don't have symptoms,people who got an alert on their phone wouldn't need to isolate for longer than that,inference
testing along with using the app is an option to work out precisely how this would work,this is why we are piloting it,inference

"one of the major issues that concerns many viewers that will download the mobile app is our reluctance for the government to access our private data and all the privacy issues of using such data for track, trace and quarantine then the authorities can track if we have caught the virus to pinpoint where we have been and whom we have had contact with",to be a success it is essential that the authorities have access to our personal data,inference
all these discussions about comparisons and we are not sure Britain has a lot of capability,"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like Britain, with all of its capability, should have done better",inference
until the government shows some integrity we can't begin to see how we can move forward what AudienceMember 20220224QT01 said in her question is we didn't plan ahead,AudienceMember 20220224QT01's question is absolutely spot on,inference
Afua Hirsch has not seen any conversation about which liberties we are giving away happen yet we need this app and to be able to track and trace,we absolutely need the track and trace technology,inference
