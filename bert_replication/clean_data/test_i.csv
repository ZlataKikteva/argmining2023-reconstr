Greg Hands remembers when Emily Thornberry got attacked for what her husband does in the House of Commons,Christopher Nugee wasn't attacked,conflict
Rishi Sunak's wife's statement explains she is an Indian national,Rishi Sunak's wife being an Indian national has got nothing to do with her having a non-domiciled status,conflict

"even the USA has less covid deaths per 100,000 than the UK at 21.7","so other countries are all lower death toll per 100,000 from covid than the UK, which has a nationwide lockdown and the toll is significantly higher at 44.4 per 100,000 inhabitants",rephrase
the numbers are very concerning,the numbers are very concerning if you look at the levels of mortality we have in this country,rephrase
Afua Hirsch would like to see some honesty from the government acknowledging that this situation was not well handled,mistakes have been made,rephrase
the government's rhetoric is only losing further trust,trust is quite important now,rephrase
the Coronavirus,there were concerns about the infection of the Coronavirus spreading,rephrase
the second component is the United Kingdom government's tone,to hear the United Kingdom government congratulating itself on the way it's happened,rephrase
we didn't lockdown fast enough,"there should have been a hard, fast lockdown",rephrase
"there should have been a hard, fast lockdown","in hindsight we know that a hard, fast lockdown would have been better",rephrase
what should have happened is we should have spent much more time planning early on,we just didn't plan well enough ahead Juergen Maier is afraid,rephrase
we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,"having the highest, or second or third highest, death toll in Europe is not where we want to be",rephrase
"people who have stayed at home, observed social distancing, our fabulous NHS and everybody who responded to this crisis","people have stayed at home, observed social distancing, our fabulous NHS and everybody who responded to this crisis is all to save lives and decrease terrible death toll",rephrase
London is a huge city,London is a city with a big public transportation system,rephrase
there was no reference to the fact those comparisons might be a bit dodgy when we were below the other European countries,George Eustice never said about the dodgy comparisons of COVID responses by countries earlier,rephrase
we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,"so other countries are all lower death toll per 100,000 from covid than the UK, which has a nationwide lockdown and the toll is significantly higher at 44.4 per 100,000 inhabitants",rephrase
George Eustice can or cannot explain to us the details of how the track and trace app is going to work,xxx happens after someone gets a ping on their phone that they have been in contact with symptoms of Coronavirus,rephrase
we have all done everything we can to try to mitigate this crisis,we are trying to come together and help,rephrase
the government not being honest doesn't make trying to come together and help a success,the government not being honest makes us people who are suffering and doing our absolute best in circumstances where we can't help with,rephrase
George Eustice is saying we did everything at the right time,George Eustice is saying lockdown was done at the right time,rephrase

Fiona Bruce doesn't recall Labour calling for a lockdown earlier,"Labour didn't call for a lockdown in February, say, for example",rephrase
we will come to a point in the future when we must look very robustly with great scrutiny as to what the government is doing and what differently it could have done throughout this crisis,we have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have,rephrase
we have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have,"Nick Thomas-Symonds hopes the government is learning lessons as it is going along on the issues of testing and tracing, on the issues of personal protective equipment to try to minimise loss of life going forward",rephrase
the issue of testing and tracing of the lockdown was absolutely essential,tracing and testing strategy is absolutely essential as the lockdown would be a blunt instrument without it,rephrase
the government was actually doing community testing but it stopped doing that on 12th of March,when the Government stopped community testing on the 12th of March it was originally said that it was a policy decision,rephrase
it took weeks and weeks after that for the government to then start to actually ramp up testing to the level that it needed to be at,the Government testing has not got to the correct level yet,rephrase
tracing and testing strategy is absolutely essential as the lockdown would be a blunt instrument without it,"testing needs to be attached to a proper tracing strategy in order for it to work, and that really has to be a focus now for the government in the weeks ahead",rephrase
the app needs to be linked to the right track and tracing resource,"if, for example, you have been in close contact with somebody, you will want to get a test very, very quickly",rephrase
"one of the issues is by focusing, as we have done, on purely hitting that 100,000","the government has focused on hitting that 100,000 target by April 30th",rephrase
you then wait for the test from 7 to 10 days,now Coronavirus tests are taking five days,rephrase
AudienceMember 20220224QT02 agrees with some of the points made,we have got to wait and receive,rephrase
"we are now at 100,000 capacity",the number of testing equipment is going to be doubling over the next month,rephrase

care home staff are not getting COVID-19 tests in time,many care home staff are saying every day they can't get their hands on tests,rephrase
we will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down,if there are hot spots that flare up and action is needed we will have that knowledge,rephrase
the crucial thing is the app is not going to be storing and recording people's locations that can be identified to an individual,the app uses a system that keeps all of that data anonymous,rephrase
the app uses a system that keeps all of that data anonymous,"the app operates, as a system that keeps people's identity in a clear of any involvement",rephrase
other countries have already resolved some of these track and trace app problems,other countries have resolved some of the track and trace issues,rephrase
the app is very much part of the track and trace strategy,the app is an essential tool as we look at that tracing strategy now going forward,rephrase
what we will need is the results of that pilot or trial in the Isle of Wight circulated very quickly,the NHS will need to know very quickly what they are meant to be doing,rephrase
the government keeps getting distracted by the wrong things,the government were too consumed about models and herd immunity,rephrase
close contacts of people contacted by track and trace should self-isolate as well,xxx is how long should people close to people contacted by track and trace isolate for,rephrase
it has yet to be decided how long close contacts of people contacted by track and trace should isolate for,two weeks is being suggested,rephrase
let's understand how it works to be clear,one gets an alert on their phone saying you have been in touch with someone who's reported in systems as having Coronavirus,rephrase
one gets an alert on their phone saying you have been in touch with someone who's reported in systems as having Coronavirus,"self-isolate for a fortnight, then your family has to self-isolate for a fortnight as well",rephrase
these are all details that are being worked through but essentially,we don't know yet,rephrase
the lack of clarity on procedure is why the Government are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,track and trace could be very powerful once you get to,rephrase
"if people in the Isle of Wight are doing it, they must know what they should do","if contacted, trialists on the Isle of Wight should self-isolate",rephrase
"if you wind back to 10, 12 weeks, we were looking at what had happened in Northern Italy where their health system has been completely overwhelmed",we had the awful prospect of people turning up to hospitals  and simply not being able to be treated in Northern Italy,rephrase

we should be doing more,we have to help these tracers to get at least 70 to 90% success rate,rephrase
"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like Britain, with all of its capability, should have done better",we should be doing better,rephrase
there were some key lessons about testing,we have got a long way to go,rephrase
"to the point of data, this needs absolute trust and transparency",everybody needs to understand exactly what the data is going to be used for,rephrase
"to the point of data, this needs absolute trust and transparency","that's what it's about, an absolute trust that this data will not be used for any commercial purpose",rephrase
one of the things incredibly striking about talking to you is the degree in which it varies very much,talk to National Health Service Trust Chief Executives in London it has been really difficult,rephrase
talk to National Health Service Trust Chief Executives in London it has been really difficult,"talk to those in the south where George Eustice's constituency is, they have said they have not experienced that level of demand they were expecting",rephrase
there are issues about how we exit lockdown,there are issues about which sectors of the economy you try to tentatively open and at which stage,rephrase
it is certain AudienceMember 20220224QT08 is desperate to get out of the house,AudienceMember 20220224QT08 will not be alone in being desperate to get out of the house,rephrase

Nick Thomas-Symonds' view on Scotland easing lockdown is xxx,the rate of infection is xxx,rephrase

"if you were just doing it solely on the basis of where you have prevalence of Coronavirus, what the first peak has taught us is you are guessing very differential rates of spread in different areas","the figures today about the death rate among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities is twice that of white people once you take into account numerous factors",rephrase
we have these regional disparities but we have this remarkable disparity in ethnicity,today figures show if you are a black man in country you are four times more likely to die from this disease if you just take age into account,rephrase
"now account for other economic factors, like self-reported health conditions, housing conditions",where you live,rephrase
"now account for other economic factors, like self-reported health conditions, housing conditions",poverty,rephrase
there also needs to be policing of the guidelines,we have ways to do it,rephrase
we have ways to do it,every company knows how to do risk assessments to keep people safe at work,rephrase
every company knows how to do risk assessments to keep people safe at work,the same rules apply here and we have a Health and Safety Executive which can help enforce that and make sure that they are working together with businesses and we are creating the right safe working environment,rephrase
what we tried to do throughout this crisis is to be supportive,throughout the COVID-19 crisis Labour quite rightly supported the government in its aim of minimising loss of life,rephrase
we have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have,xxx is how the government let it happen when we have a death toll as we have,rephrase
Afua Hirsch has issues with the inquiry and gaining trust among those affected so far,Afua Hirsch's issue with the inquiry is that if we start easing restrictions what measures will be taken to ensure people who returned to work are protected,rephrase
"many ethnic groups, like black and Asian women are all more likely to die from COVID",there is actually quite a wide number of ethnic minorities or the communities whose lives are at stake here,rephrase
That's not true,many ethnic groups being more likely to die from COVID was taken seriously,rephrase
the reason the Health and Safety Executive exists is because there are companies that don't take it seriously enough,George Eustice is suggesting that the companies who don't take health and safety seriously all suddenly will,rephrase
"in these circumstances, the Health and Safety Executive have been involved with some of the guidance with food companies",Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency were also involved in guidance to food companies,rephrase
It is important to note there are sectors of economy that never shut down,the food industry George Eustice is responsible for never shut down,rephrase
everybody takes workers rights very seriously,employers take the duty to care for their employees very seriously,rephrase
Chris Hopson was talking to a hospital Chief Executive the other day who had difficulty dividing their hospital into a COVID and non-COVID zone,the difficulty in dividing the hospital into a COVID and non-COVID zone actually created issues,rephrase
what we also know is that life is now becoming really complex,there are lots of complexities particularly for those working in health and care settings to ensure they are providing a safe environment for their staff,rephrase
indeed a lot of the economy is working today,the retail sector is working and some other sectors are working,rephrase
the difficulty of being too prescriptive is that different companies will have different approaches,In the retail sector a small convenience store will have a different approach to a large supermarket,rephrase
the difficulty of being too prescriptive is that different companies will have different approaches,You need to have flexibility for employers to do what works in their environment,rephrase
You need to have flexibility for employers to do what works in their environment,"in the office environment where Unknown Speaker cited hot desking, the reality is there will be a strong argument for businesses that are office based to encourage people to work from home as far as possible so you don't have high density of people in those offices sharing equipment",rephrase
there will be lots of responsible employers who are doing the kinds of things George Eustice is doing,there will be employers taking the right steps and investing and caring about protecting their workforce,rephrase
"when we have talked to our staff about what might happen, things they immediately raised were what is it going to be like travelling into the central part of the city and being on a packed tube train and next to people that might present a safety risk",public transport into the centre of London is one of the issues the government faces,rephrase
we have the example of other countries ahead of us,having other countries examples ahead of us is helpful,rephrase
"every director of a company, every employer knows their responsibility towards keeping their employees safe",it is crystal clear,rephrase
it is the few employers that don't take their employees safety seriously,it is not that many employers that don't take their employees safety seriously in my experience,rephrase
what you actually need is leaders who think the welfare of their staff is by far the most important thing,certainly that's the way we act as our senior leadership team in our organisation,rephrase
what people discovered is once those social distancing measures were put in place staff returned to work,some people returned from being in isolation,rephrase

"in Newcastle, you do have a flare-up",Newcastle was the example that was used,rephrase
what we need to do is we also need to say there is evidence that clearly black men are unfortunately more vulnerable in this situation,we need to be more supportive of black men until we get to the point where we have got another science to understand why this is really happening,rephrase
we need to be risk assessing our workplaces,we need to be looking at what's required in terms of distancing,rephrase
we need to be looking at what's required in terms of distancing,"whether it is screens, supplying any appropriate personal protective equipment required in terms for of distancing",rephrase
we need to be risk assessing our workplaces,we absolutely need an enforcement of the risk-assessing guidelines,rephrase
"if we can enforce those guidlines, then we can have confidence going forward that people do feel safe going to work",employers as well feel safe over what they are required to do,rephrase
we absolutely need an enforcement of the risk-assessing guidelines,there are local authorities as well,rephrase

the current situation has only made it a lot harder to communicate the core messages that people need to hear,who one trusts in terms to give you a truthful picture of the situation is what we mostly talked about tonight,inference
given the evidence that was available to ministers making that decision,the ministers made the right decision about the care sector,inference
it's not the same for every person,you should try and explore that for people who just choose not to get vaccinated,inference
you should try and explore that for people who just choose not to get vaccinated,maybe other options might be a solution to your NHS crisis,inference
Dominic Cummings's current Chief of Staff has just resigned,"there have been four or five resignations today, this evening",inference
we are seeing the media cheerfully picking up all the information Dominic Cummings is leeching out bit by bit into the media,the stories are coming out bit by bit,inference
the stories are coming out bit by bit,we are or are not being played here,inference
we are being played here,we should understand the circumstances,inference
people who have very properly followed the rules very precisely are understandably extremely cross,being played by Dominic Cummings doesn't mean we shouldn't be conscious about the effect it has on people who have very properly followed the rules very precisely,inference
there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates,Chris Hopson's public health colleagues tell him to be very careful about making international comparisons at this point,inference
there is not a single universal way of recording Coronavirus and none Coronavirus,there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates,inference
mistakes have been made,Afua Hirsch would like to see the government telling us clearly and transparently what they intend to do differently,inference
we have not got a grip on this situation,"we are experiencing, the number of people dying, the heart breaking scenarios of people dying alone often in unnecessary circumstances",inference
trust is quite important now,until the government shows some integrity we can't begin to see how we can move forward,inference
the Coronavirus,Afua Hirsch remembers in February two local schools where she lives in South London were closed,inference
"clearly we are at 30,000 deaths",these deaths are a real issue,inference
we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,we are the worst in Europe,inference
"people who have stayed at home, observed social distancing, our fabulous NHS and everybody who responded to this crisis",the Prime Minister was describing what we have all done as a country against COVID as an apparent success,inference
it is right to acknowledge the steps people have taken,acknowledging the steps people have taken is what the Prime Minister was doing,inference
London is a city with a big public transportation system,London having a big public transportation system could have had an impact early on in the pandemic,inference
now we are dealing with this epidemic,there will be a time to reflect and learn lessons at the end of the pandemic,inference
lockdown preparation meetings were occupying all of Matt Hancock's time,lots and lots of planning and preparation went into responding to a lockdown,inference
"as soon as the advice was we should lockdown, that's exactly what we did",the scientific advice was not that we should have locked down earlier than we did,inference
The idea is people will go on to the app,they will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way,inference
they will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way,if their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time,inference
if their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time,that person subsequently shows symptoms and reports those symptoms,inference
that person subsequently shows symptoms and reports those symptoms,those other people who have been in close or regular contact with that person will receive a notification to say that someone who they were in close contact with has reported symptoms,inference
comparisons made us look good,initially we liked the comparisons,inference
now comparisons make us look bad,now we can't trust comparisons,inference
"the definition of testing was changed when it emerged that we couldn't meet the 100,000 a day standard we were promised",the government has been changing its narrative to fit its results,inference
we deserve an honest acknowledgment of the leadership failing us,you feel the leadership has failed us,inference
Nick Thomas-Symonds is afraid that hitting the target on 30th of April was done by putting a number of tests in the post without actual guarantee that those tests had been used,the Government testing has not got to the correct level yet,inference
"the government has focused on hitting that 100,000 target by April 30th",we have not really quite got the geographic spread we need of testing,inference
we have not really quite got the geographic spread we need of testing,the geographic spread of testing will need to be ramped up,inference
the NHS needs to play its part,we need support also from the government,inference
care home staff have to apply online for COVID-19 tests,care home staff are not getting COVID-19 tests in time,inference
the information commissioner not being consulted potentially fails the NHS app standards for data protection,xxx are what assurances the government can give us in the data protection standards,inference
otherwise it won't work,as soon as you develop symptoms of Coronavirus you have to have that data on a database,inference
people who got an alert on their phone don't have symptoms,people who got an alert on their phone wouldn't need to isolate for longer than that,inference
to work out precisely how this would work,this is why we are piloting it,inference
the app will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms,the app could be very powerful,inference
the app will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms,we will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down,inference
the app could be very powerful,this is why we are piloting it,inference
other countries have already resolved some of these track and trace app problems,what Juergen Maier is a a bit surprised about is that we are not learning from countries that are further ahead of track and trace development,inference
we have two potential track and trace apps,we can get one of the track and trace apps to work very quickly,inference
we need to get a track and trace app online,we can get one of the track and trace apps to work very quickly,inference
the app is very much part of the track and trace strategy,we have been arguing a strategy on track and trace for some considerable time now,inference
at the moment nobody in the NHS knows what role they are meant to be playing to support the app,what we will need is the results of that pilot or trial in the Isle of Wight circulated very quickly,inference
George Eustice doesn't seem to be clear how the app works,people need to know how the app works,inference
the government were too consumed about models and herd immunity,we were talking about why the government didn't have tests in place earlier,inference
we are not sure how the app is going to work,the app is being tried in the Isle of Wight,inference
this is something that may be coming the way of all of us,let's understand how it works to be clear,inference
we don't know,the lack of clarity on procedure is why the Government are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,inference
"if people in the Isle of Wight are doing it, they must know what they should do",the procedures must have been worked out,inference
"the press conferences have been very, very candid about the nature of this crisis, the reasons we are doing the things we are doing, very candid about the evidence and epidemiology behind it",we have been as frank as possible with the public,inference
"the NHS has actually created 33,000 beds to cater to Coronavirus patients",we have created 7 Nightingale hospitals literally within the space of a fortnight,inference
we shared with the public all of our thinking,we have been as frank as possible with the public,inference
track and tracing is going to be successful,we have to help these tracers to get at least 70 to 90% success rate,inference
then the authorities can track if we have caught the virus to pinpoint where we have been and whom we have had contact with,to be a success it is essential that the authorities have access to our personal data,inference
Britain has a lot of capability,"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like Britain, with all of its capability, should have done better",inference
what AudienceMember 20220224QT01 said in her question is we didn't plan ahead,AudienceMember 20220224QT01's question is absolutely spot on,inference
we need this app and to be able to track and trace,we absolutely need the track and trace technology,inference
"the track and trace technology has been the strategy in countries that have managed the pandemic very successfully, in South Korea, for example",we need this app and to be able to track and trace,inference
the set of data is going to have to be held centrally,you are going to pick up those different parts of the country where there are outbreaks,inference
we need to understand the two different apps actually have different ways in which the data is hemmed,we are missing something important here,inference
we are missing which feels important to Chris Hopson one of the things about lockdown which is the consistent lack of national communications,we try to have different areas doing different things at different times,inference
unlike some of those other apps you get better information about where you might get local flare ups,we are able to respond to flare ups and monitor local or regional pick up in the virus,inference
we have to see this as what it is,we have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we have all made too many sacrifices,we have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we are trying to get out of lockdown to save the economy and jobs,it is certain AudienceMember 20220224QT08 is desperate to get out of the house,inference
in the north we have seen high death rates in towns like Sunderland,AudienceMember 20220224QT09 does not know if these death rates should be managed in the same way as other parts of the country like the Northway,inference
"the guidelines, for example, are slightly different",there have been moments in the crisis where Wales have taken slightly different decisions,inference
we do all share these islands,taking a four nations approach has been the sensible way to proceed,inference
different at the moment but in ordinary circumstances working people commute over the border,"it gets very difficult if you have things that are very, very different in different parts of the country",inference
"some of us from the first anecdotal evidence of this, from the beginning have been asking for concerted evidence as to why certain ethnic groups appear to be so much at risk",there is an inquiry into why some Ethnic groups are at a bigger risk,inference
"so that everybody can have confidence, whether it is employers or employees","we have been working for a national safety standard and putting that together with employers, with the employees and of course across political parties",inference
clearly we are not out of the woods on this by any means,we are going to be very cautious,inference
we really need to trust the tracers to be able to meet that target to contain this virus of 70% to 90% of the people,we need to give the tracers as much information as possible,inference
you need a pretty significant take-up to get the information you want from the government's new tracking app,the government's new tracking app is or is not really going to be of any use,inference
Matt Hancock has set up this inquiry,many ethnic groups being more likely to die from COVID was taken seriously,inference
all of the agencies have been working and contributing to the guidance that businesses are following,Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency were also involved in guidance to food companies,inference
We want people to feel safe to return to work,the government has been doing a lot of work over the last few weeks with unions and employers,inference
"food manufacturers, diaries, meat producers, they have all managed to put in place social distancing measures",people going in April to supermarket see social distancing measures put in place,inference
"people who are vulnerable, who are too insecure to be able to challenge employers at work or depend on zero hours contracts, won't be protected if we don't have stringent measures that are not optional",we need stringent measures that are not optional,inference
"people who are vulnerable, who are too insecure to be able to challenge employers at work or depend on zero hours contracts, won't be protected if we don't have stringent measures that are not optional","we ought to be thinking about the worst case, not best case scenario",inference
the difficulty in dividing the hospital into a COVID and non-COVID zone actually created issues,what we also know is that life is now becoming really complex,inference
the retail sector is working and some other sectors are working,we learn from those sectors which are working,inference
we know we don't have a perfect record of safety at work,there are employers who will flout good practice,inference
assurances are not crystal clear,there are employers who will flout good practice,inference
the Government had been honest with us and taken all these concerns seriously from the beginning,it would be a lot easier to listen to proposed guidelines about returning to work,inference
there will always be employers who are not responsible and willing to put their workers at risk,we need a bit of reality,inference
"when we have talked to our staff about what might happen, things they immediately raised were what is it going to be like travelling into the central part of the city and being on a packed tube train and next to people that might present a safety risk",an example of the complocations is we work in the centre of London,inference
public transport into the centre of London is one of the issues the government faces,we also need to ensure transport is appropriately configured,inference
public transportation is quite an issue if we are going to be able to enable and support people to come back to work,we also need to ensure transport is appropriately configured,inference
employers take their employees safety seriously,most employers would add COVID guidelines to keep their employees safe,inference
the Health and Safety Executive will enforce the COVID guidelines on the few employers that don't take their employees safety seriously,employers don't take their employees safety seriously,inference
we have a very narrow corridor which effectively enables people to get to and from their desk,in our office it is difficult to follow guidelines,inference
we have a very narrow corridor which effectively enables people to get to and from their desk,there is no way we are going to be able to observe social distancing,inference
"when this comes to ambulance workers, community trust workers, hospital workers Chris Hopson is obviously here as the face of that","Chris Hopson does or does not think that these protections should be legally binding, as it is being suggested or optional extras, as John is suggesting",inference
businesses need the ingenuity of staff to help them do things like work out how they would create a system if they have a narrow corridor,certainly that's the way we act as our senior leadership team in our organisation,inference
what people discovered is once those social distancing measures were put in place staff returned to work,20% is down to 4 to 5% which is not much different from normal,inference
the messaging wasn't quite clear enough,as we come out we have to be together to help simplify the messaging,inference
there have already been variations of COVID-19 across the UK,Nick Thomas-Symonds does accept there will be variations of COVID-19,inference
these lockdown restrictions start to ease and there is a particular area where the tracing app showed that there was a very specific problem,you might have to look at that specific area too,inference
"if we can enforce those guidlines, then we can have confidence going forward that people do feel safe going to work",we really need to make sure is that there are sufficient resources available for that enforcement to take place,inference
there would be huge risks to standing up to the no fly zone,the Defence Secretary outlined why standing up to the no fly zone would be very difficult to do,inference

what we don't do is put bureaucratic barriers to refugees coming,you don't insist they have friends and family and they prove they have friends and family,inference
manual labour for entry into the United Kingdom is one of the routes that the Government are promoting at the moment,the minister of immigration should go there himself and he should stand on that border and he should explain to people coming across who are in extremely vulnerable situations and he should just be forced to say that they can only come here if they work in our fields doing manual labour,inference

"a British historian made the point if you go to the memorial to Soviet soldiers in Berlin, these are people who defeated Nazis and they are great heroes and they're buried in mass graves",Soviet soldiers in Berlin didn't have the dignity of being buried in their own grave,inference
using nuclear weapons doesn't stop there,using nuclear weapons is also a self-destruct button,inference
if Russian leaders are thinking about their own survival,to use a nuclear weapon is not a good strategy to survive,inference
to use a nuclear weapon is not a good strategy to survive,you have to worry that Mr Putin is rational now or not,inference
the consequences of launching a first strike are so terrible,people don't do nuclear launches,inference
the things Putin has said are not leading to nuclear launching,Penny Mordaunt's message to you is don't be afraid,inference
