this is a difficult thing for me as a lifelong Conservative to be sitting here,that's what I am saying tonight,conflict
The rules should apply to everyone equally,it doesn't seem to apply to the government,conflict

You could have kept the cap in place,There has been a cut in our budget from the UK government,conflict

Itâs why itâs been so frustrating to see the governmentâs response to this,entering into this blame game,rephrase
entering into this blame game,refusing to work with people to build a national consensus around this,rephrase
the most significant from the Prime Minister's policy adviser,one of his closest most long-standing and loyal adviser Munira,rephrase
the apology by Keir Starmer on behalf of the CPS as DPP precisely parallels the apology of the Prime Minister on behalf of Number 10,Where he is taking responsibility for the organisation,rephrase
How much do you think you would get from the windfall tax?,How much money do you think?,rephrase
That's not targeted,That's bills for everybody,rephrase
that money will be clawed back,buy now it pay later,rephrase
the Government has come up with the right policy,a balance between 150 pounds targeted at houses that are at the bottom end of the Council tax bands,rephrase
the Government has come up with the right policy,"200 pounds off all the bills, and 350 pounds combined to all the other measures that have been taken to address the cost of living is the right balance",rephrase
this is on top of rising fuel costs,the weekly shop going up,rephrase
the weekly shop going up,we are seeing national insurance contributions going up,rephrase
The cost of living is going through the roof,This is having a real squeeze on working people,rephrase
we are seeing national insurance contributions going up,This is having a real squeeze on working people,rephrase
We have got to divide the responsibility for the organisation,the Prime Minister has taken and Keir Starmer took for the actions of the CPS as DPP,rephrase
"It beggar's belief that we have Crispin trying to defend the indefensible and to liken the horrible smearing of Keir Starmer, and involve you know, Jimmy Savile's victim's families",this mess which is frankly of the Prime Minister's making,rephrase
He lied to Parliament,He lied to the country,rephrase
He lied to the country,He's taken the country for fools,rephrase
He's taken the country for fools,He was at parties,rephrase
He was at parties,His staff were packing suitcases full of alcohol working out which person was going to be the DJ while people in this room were probably burying their families,rephrase
with a we borrowed then to be able to get through it,You think we borrowed too much,rephrase
Perhaps we were a little overprotective,overzealous,rephrase
people shouldn't be having to choose whether they can eat and heat their houses,their homes,rephrase
There must be a better way to do it,a more efficient way to do it,rephrase
a more efficient way to do it,a more immediate fashion,rephrase
You have aligned three different things,I completely understand why you have done it,rephrase
you have got NHS staff who have done an absolutely brilliant job during the Covid crisis,doing all the things that you explained,rephrase
you can't fairly put those circumstances alongside each other,You need to understand the circumstances inside Number 10,rephrase
we have to keep trying,keep trying to get them vaccinated,rephrase
you have to take precautions,everybody around you has to take precautions,rephrase
Yet I don't feel like there's an open conversation about the side effects,"the potential risks especially to young people, and for children",rephrase
"When we talk about healthcare staff, I think everybody who works in the health system has a duty of care",That duty of care first of all is to do no harm,rephrase
we need to work with people rather than against them,we need to work with people not against them,rephrase
he is the first person who has considered the rights of people who aren't vaccinated,talked about whether someone has the right to take the vaccine,rephrase
talked about whether someone has the right to take the vaccine,not as opposed to the balance sheet that is argument that's presented,rephrase
I have come across patients that maybe are overweight or have diabetes and seem to be worried about fertility risks,the fact that the vaccines cause clots and other misinformation that's spread across Social Media or other forms of media,rephrase
"sometimes, markets go wrong",this one is going wrong,rephrase
this one is going wrong,that's true,rephrase
"The Conservative Government has taken policies from Labour which have distorted the market, be it the application of a cap on to energy bills",It distorts things,rephrase
That's what we do in this country,I do,rephrase
I remember what it's like not to have proper heating,"I remember, you know, rheumatism",rephrase
"I remember, you know, rheumatism",I remember the chest infections,rephrase
I remember the chest infections,I remember all those things,rephrase
they should pay more,Let's ask some of the energy producers to actually dip into the profits and share it with the poorest,rephrase
there are a number of factors,one of them is the notion that Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people have been badly treated,rephrase
You can't just look at those bills on their own,you have to look at the hike in food prices,rephrase
giving everybody the equal amount is fine if you are middle class,"If you are poor, it doesn't have that impact",rephrase
poverty costs us in health,the impact of poverty on mental health,rephrase
the impact of poverty on mental health,Rosena will support this is significant,rephrase
"it's our frontline workers from our poorest, and Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) group backgrounds who are in these beds","our posties, bus drivers, shop workers",rephrase
these are the people who feel most let down by the Government during the pandemic,"It's very difficult for them to then trust someone who breaks all the rules to say yes, take our vaccine, you will be fine, you will be safe",rephrase
the very best people I have ever met in my life were the black carers that were looking after him,The best people I have ever met,rephrase
"it's our frontline workers from our poorest, and Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) group backgrounds who are in these beds",They were vaccine hesitant,rephrase
these are the people who feel most let down by the Government during the pandemic,they said they felt so let down by the Government,rephrase
They just needed to be persuaded of it,persuasion is better than forcing people by threatening them with job loss,rephrase
what happened was inevitable,the Government has taken a step-back,rephrase
"If you are a leader of a hospital, and you have had to basically get your senior staff out there","sometimes hundreds of staff, nobody likes, least of all people in the NHS telling somebody they will lose their job because they have made a decision",rephrase
They find out the Government has changed its mind not from a message from the Secretary of State,Not from a question how do we do this,rephrase
Not from a question how do we do this,on the media,rephrase
on the media,They find out on the media,rephrase
the Government has taken a step-back,They have to reverse ferret in front of those very staff who have built their trust,rephrase
"the point about NHS staff, the principal of when you go to Medical School or you study to be a nurse or a physio or anything within our NHS, is it's actually a vocation not a job",We believe in doing no harm,rephrase
We believe in doing no harm,you don't want to harm your patients,rephrase
We have got to divide the responsibility for the organisation,the Prime Minister has taken and Keir Starmer took for the actions of the CPS as DPP,rephrase
"by spreading the virus, or putting them by undue stress",they know there are healthcare staff who are resistant to getting vaccines in the frontline working roles is a significant issue,rephrase
"Scientists spend their life, I spend my life looking at evidence and questioning it",I spend my life,rephrase
the same new Labour philosophy at work,A philosophy which sees Government money as the Government's,rephrase
Not the calculation I have seen,Not just green but other levies,rephrase
they would be using the gas crisis as an opportunity to retrofit a lot of the homes in the UK,that would be the long-term solution that they really should be doing,rephrase
I would be interested to know why it seems in the past week there has been less focus by the opposition party upon these cost of living concerns,has instead primarily focused upon the issues of party gate,rephrase
When are we going to start holding these big corporations to account,when will the Government hold them to account,rephrase
to reduce the demand for gas,which would not only help with fuel poverty,rephrase
to reduce the demand for gas,help with the coming climate crisis,rephrase
one thing which doesn't get discussed is natural immunity,the conversation about natural immunity should be raised more often,rephrase
you want to do a data analysis,look at the risk ratio and hazard ratios,rephrase
look at the risk ratio and hazard ratios,you can get those numbers,rephrase
The rarest events of any serious concern is inflammation of the heart,"it's extremely rare, very unlikely to happen",rephrase
The evidence and the facts are there,They are indisputable,rephrase
most of the data in the UK comes from The Yellow Card reporting scheme,is a self-reporting scheme,rephrase
So I think the issue here is it's not just about personal choice,"I respect personal choice, and of course, you can make your own decisions",rephrase
You are not just getting vaccinated to ensure your own health,It's about ensuring everybody else's health,rephrase
We tried incentives like giving away a free pen,We tried a competition for an iPad,rephrase
"there are things that we can, and should and are doing to encourage those staff to take up the vaccine","engaging those community leaders in understanding the fact, and then explaining it",rephrase
"engaging those community leaders in understanding the fact, and then explaining it",making the vaccine present in their community through buses,rephrase
making the vaccine present in their community through buses,"constantly acknowledging their concerns, and bringing those concerns to the fore",rephrase
is nothing he says credible to you,"Given how, what an eminent scientist he is",rephrase
learned an appeal to authority is not an automatic win of an argument,we want to appeal to authority,rephrase
He didn't invent mRNA vaccines,"The people who developed the vaccines, the two Rna vaccines are Biontech, the company invented RNA vaccines, and the other group are Moderna",rephrase
we can talk about say Dr Robert Malone who invented the vaccine,inventing mRNA vaccines,rephrase
I have to consider the dignity of the individual. And their right to refuse something to be done to them,you are denying the dignity of that individual,rephrase
"Whenever you impose something on people, and you take away bodily autonomy","When society takes that step, that's a step away from freedom too far from me",rephrase
what I do find really annoying is the attack on us all the time for choosing what we know best for ourself,That's where I stand,rephrase
there are things that we can do,There are things that we should do,rephrase
Yes,it's you and everybody else in the restaurant,rephrase
You have to suffer the consequences,You have an individual right absolutely,rephrase
it's you and everybody else in the restaurant,You also have the individual responsibility to understand the consequences of that choice on other people,rephrase
"we need to be you know, bring down the temperature",let's understand the facts,rephrase
let's understand the facts,let's help people understand the vaccine,rephrase
it's not though say the Government has not been supporting ethnic ambassadors to make the case on vaccines into the community,They have been,rephrase
I'm amongst a minority who rather likes him,"He reminds me of a character in an oceans 11 film, technically he may be a conman and the bad guy but you want to see if he gets away with it",rephrase
It's frustrating after 12 years of a Tory Government in power to have this crisis,the same new Labour philosophy at work,rephrase
The issue is not the irreparable damage to the Conservative Party but to the country,He wasn't fit to lead the country before we went into the pandemic,rephrase
he is an absolute consistent liar,the people closest to him are now jumping ship,rephrase
"it also means if you don't ask the questions, you won't necessarily get the answers",That means that the questions percolate out there,rephrase
That means that the questions percolate out there,"it means people are again, likely to stay away from having vaccines",rephrase
"on the moral point, and the gentleman with his degree in philosophy, which was a good thing to have by the way but of course it won't protect you from the virus",degrees in medicine are probably much more useful in that regard,rephrase
"give you the security that those vulnerable members of your family who you have persuaded to get vaccines for very real reasons, you are not going to be passing on the virus to them",You are going to be better able to protect them,rephrase
the day you get your antibodies measured will give you some idea of your immune response,it won't tell you how long that lasts,rephrase
take responsibility,search truth,rephrase
search truth,To look for that in the examples of leadership,rephrase
I was brought up to tell the truth,take responsibility,rephrase
it's not just the politics,it's the moral leadership,rephrase
this is the country,it's not just the politics,rephrase
the first is the moral vacuum at the top of the Government,there's a moral vacuum,rephrase
people might not have known who Keir Starmer was,they do now,rephrase
it's not just an error,it's moral leadership,rephrase
whoever replaces him has now got to actually an opposition which people kind of know about,partly because of the sort of error,rephrase
It's about how you stand,It's about do you have values,rephrase
It's about how you stand,That's what is important here,rephrase
It's about how you stand,Do you have a moral compass,rephrase
it's all truth what he is telling us,It's not fabricated or made up,rephrase
many of the issues we talked about tonight relate to trust,Who do you trust in terms to give you a truthful picture of the situation,rephrase
he made some decisions but the NHS got the vaccine done,credit where credit is due,rephrase
the problem is we have got this Prime Minister not the last Prime Ministers,That's the problem,rephrase
We have been talking about this for a long time,so many put in questions about this,rephrase
No-one should deny that,"what is sitting behind that is the Prime Minister's former Chief of Staff who has then sitting there, leeching out bit by bit information into the media",rephrase
You are talking about Dominic Cummings?,His current Chief of Staff has just resigned,rephrase
understandably extremely cross,It's those people who I can understand their real annoyance,rephrase
"We are plainly going through a huge crisis in terms of confidence in the Prime Minister, and the Government as it's presented in the media around the pattern of behaviour in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office over the last two years",No-one should deny that,rephrase
"this morning I read that according to statistics from John Hopkins University Sweden has 28 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, Norway has 4 deaths per 100,000, Denmark has 8.7, Finland has 4.5",Even the USA has less than the UK at 21.7,rephrase
Even the USA has less than the UK at 21.7,"So they are all lower than the UK, which has a nationwide lockdown and the toll is significantly higher at 44.4 per 100,000 inhabitants",rephrase
It is very concerning,If you look at the levels of mortality we have in this country,rephrase
What I would like to see is some honesty from the government acknowledging that this situation was not well handled,mistakes have been made,rephrase
the government's rhetoric is only losing further trust,trust is quite important now,rephrase
the Coronavirus,there were concerns about the infection spreading,rephrase
The second component is the government's tone,to hear our government congratulating itself on the way it's happened,rephrase
we didn't lockdown fast enough,"there should have been a hard, fast lockdown",rephrase
"there should have been a hard, fast lockdown",In hindsight we know that would have been better,rephrase
what should have happened is we should have spent much more time planning early on,we just didn't plan well enough ahead I am afraid,rephrase
we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,It is not where we want to be,rephrase
"people who have stayed at home, observed social distancing, our fabulous NHS and everybody who responded to this crisis",That is all to save lives and decrease terrible death toll,rephrase
London is a huge city,It is a city with a big public transportation system,rephrase
there was no reference to the fact those comparisons might be a bit dodgy when we were below the other European countries,You never said that earlier,rephrase
we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,"So they are all lower than the UK, which has a nationwide lockdown and the toll is significantly higher at 44.4 per 100,000 inhabitants",rephrase
Can you explain to us the details of how it is going to work?,What happens then,rephrase
we have all done everything we can to try to mitigate this,We are trying to come together and help,rephrase
That doesn't make this a success,It makes us people who are suffering and doing our absolute best in circumstances where we can't help with,rephrase
George is saying we did everything at the right time,Lockdown was done at the right time,rephrase
"We know what happens in a crisis, is that the crisis inevitably finds one of weakest links in terms of the area that's been underinvested and that's not been sorted out",There are some reasons I am sure,rephrase
There are some reasons I am sure,All I am saying is we need to be careful about jumping to immediate conclusions on the basis of incomplete evidence at this point,rephrase
"it is difficult to talk about celebration when we are talking about it in the context of Margaret's questions of 30,000 deaths",We should recognise that,rephrase
you raised quite correctly the fact that our social care sector has been completely neglected,"We know what happens in a crisis, is that the crisis inevitably finds one of weakest links in terms of the area that's been underinvested and that's not been sorted out",rephrase
I don't recall that,Maybe I missed it,rephrase
I don't recall that,"Labour calling for a lockdown in February, say, for example",rephrase
"The point I am making really is, of course, we will come to a point in the future when we must look very robustly with great scrutiny as to what the government is doing and what differently it could have done throughout this crisis",We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have,rephrase
We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have,"I hope the government is learning lessons as it is going along on the issues of testing and tracing, on the issues of personal protective equipment to try to minimise loss of life going forward",rephrase
The issue of testing and tracing of the lockdown was absolutely essential,it was a blunt instrument unless you have a tracing and testing strategy,rephrase
The government was actually doing community testing but it stopped doing that on 12th of March,Originally it was said that it was a policy decision,rephrase
it took weeks and weeks after that for the government to then start to actually ramp up testing to the level that it needed to be at,it's not got to that yet,rephrase
it was a blunt instrument unless you have a tracing and testing strategy,that needs to be ready again and it needs to be attached to a proper tracing strategy and that really has to be a focus now for the government in the weeks ahead,rephrase
it needs to be linked to the right track and tracing resource,"if, for example, you have been in close contact with somebody, you will want to get a test very, very quickly",rephrase
"One of the issues is by focusing, as we have done, on purely hitting that 100,000","the government has done hitting that 100,000 target by April 30th",rephrase
then wait for the test from 7 to 10 days,now they are taking five days,rephrase
I agree with some of the points,We have got to wait and receive,rephrase
"We are now at 100,000 capacity",It is going to be doubling over the next month,rephrase
It is going to be doubling over the next month,We will be ramping it up further,rephrase
I am not criticising the NHS.,they have done a wonderful job,rephrase
I am not criticising the NHS.,I am criticising the government's lack of necessary preparations,rephrase
They are not getting them in time,Many care home staff are saying every day they can't get their hands on tests,rephrase
We will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down,If there are hot spots that flare up and action is needed we will have that knowledge,rephrase
The crucial thing is it is not going to be storing and recording people's locations that can be identified to an individual,This is a system that keeps all of that data anonymous,rephrase
This is a system that keeps all of that data anonymous,"It operates, you know, as a system that keeps people's identity in a clear of any involvement",rephrase
They have already resolved some of these problems,They have resolved some,rephrase
the app is very much part of that,it is an essential tool as we look at that tracing strategy now going forward,rephrase
What we will need is the results of that pilot or trial in the Isle of Wight circulated very quickly,The NHS will need to know very quickly what they are meant to be doing,rephrase
The government keeps getting distracted by the wrong things,They were too consumed about models and herd immunity,rephrase
Self-isolate as well,For how long,rephrase
That's to be decided,Two weeks is being suggested,rephrase
Let's understand how it works to be clear,You get an alert on your phone saying you have been in touch with someone who's reported in systems as having Coronavirus,rephrase
You get an alert on your phone saying you have been in touch with someone who's reported in systems as having Coronavirus,"Self-isolate for a fortnight, then your family has to self-isolate for a fortnight as well",rephrase
These are details that are being worked through but essentially,We don't know yet,rephrase
This is why we are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,This could be very powerful once you get to,rephrase
"if people in the Isle of Wight are doing it, they must know what they should do",They should self-isolate,rephrase
"if you wind back to 10, 12 weeks, we were looking at what had happened in Northern Italy where their health system has been completely overwhelmed",we had the awful prospect of people turning up to hospitals and simply not being able to be treated,rephrase
"When measured against what we have already lost, our right to socialise, our future economic and job prospects, not to mention the potential danger to our health, does the panel feel it is a small price to pay to share parts of our personal data to control and contain this virus until a vaccine can be found",Do you think it is a price worth paying,rephrase
we should be doing more,We have to help these tracers to get at least 70 to 90% success rate,rephrase
"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like ours, like Britain, with all of its capability we should have done better",We should be doing better,rephrase
there were some key lessons,we have got a long way to go,rephrase
"to the point of data, you know, this needs absolute trust and transparency",I think everybody needs to understand exactly what the data is going to be used for,rephrase
"to the point of data, you know, this needs absolute trust and transparency","That's what it's about, an absolute trust that this data will not be used for any commercial purpose",rephrase
One of the things incredibly striking about talking to you is the degree in which it varies very much,talk to Trust Chief Executives in London it has been really difficult,rephrase
talk to Trust Chief Executives in London it has been really difficult,"talk to those in the south where George's constituency is, they have said they have not experienced that level of demand they were expecting",rephrase
There are issues about how we exit lockdown,which sectors of the economy you try to tentatively open and at which stage,rephrase
it is certain you are desperate to get out of the house,you will not be alone in that,rephrase
"the government has said it wants to create 18,000 for contact tracing",How many have been recruited so far,rephrase
what's your view about that,what is the rate of infection,rephrase
what is the rate of infection,the number of cases,rephrase
on the whole the Welsh government has tried to take a four nations approach,that has been the sensible way to proceed,rephrase
in my own constituency tier for Torfaen I would in ordinary circumstances have people who commuted to work,Different at the moment but in ordinary circumstances they commute over the border,rephrase
"If you were just doing it solely on the basis of where you have prevalence of Coronavirus, what the first peak has taught us is you are guessing very differential rates of spread in different areas","the figures today about the death rate among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities is twice that of white people once you take into account numerous factors",rephrase
We have these regional disparities but we have this remarkable disparity in ethnicity,Today figures show if you are a black man in country you are four times more likely to die from this disease if you just take age into account,rephrase
"now account for other economic factors, like self-reported health conditions, housing conditions",Where you live,rephrase
"now account for other economic factors, like self-reported health conditions, housing conditions",Poverty,rephrase
There also needs to be policing of that,We have ways to do it,rephrase
We have ways to do it,Every company knows how to do risk assessments to keep people safe at work,rephrase
Every company knows how to do risk assessments to keep people safe at work,the same rules apply here and we have a Health and Safety Executive which can help enforce that and make sure that they are working together with businesses and we are creating the right safe working environment,rephrase
"Listen, what we tried to do throughout this crisis is to be supportive, Fiona",Throughout this crisis we quite rightly supported the government in its aim of minimising loss of life,rephrase
We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have,How has the government let it happen when we have a death toll as we have,rephrase
I have issues with the inquiry and gaining trust among those affected so far,If we are to start easing restrictions what measures will be taken to ensure people who returned to work are protected,rephrase
"many ethnic groups, like black and Asian women are all more likely to die from COVID",There is actually quite a wide number of ethnic minorities or the communities whose lives are at stake here,rephrase
That's not true,It was taken seriously,rephrase
The reason the Health and Safety Executive exists is because there are companies that don't take it seriously enough,Are you suggesting that they all suddenly will,rephrase
"In these circumstances, the Health and Safety Executive have been involved with some of the guidance with food companies",Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency as well,rephrase
It is important to note there are sectors of economy that never shut down,The food industry I am responsible for,rephrase
Everybody takes this very seriously,Employers take the duty to care for their employees very seriously,rephrase
I was talking to a hospital Chief Executive the other day who had difficulty dividing their hospital into a COVID and non-COVID zone,That's actually created issues,rephrase
What we also know is that life is now becoming really complex,There are lots of complexities particularly for those working in health and care settings to ensure they are providing a safe environment for their staff,rephrase
indeed a lot of the economy is working today,The retail sector is working and some other sectors are working,rephrase
The difficulty being too prescriptive is that different companies will have different approaches,In the retail sector a small convenience store will have a different approach to a large supermarket,rephrase
The difficulty being too prescriptive is that different companies will have different approaches,You need to have flexibility for employers to do what works in their environment,rephrase
You need to have flexibility for employers to do what works in their environment,"In the office environment where he cited hot desking, the reality is there will be a strong argument for businesses that are office based to encourage people to work from home as far as possible so you don't have high density of people in those offices sharing equipment",rephrase
There will be lots of responsible employers who are doing the kinds of things you are doing,taking the right steps and investing and caring about protecting their workforce,rephrase
"When we have talked to our staff about what might happen, things they immediately raised were what is it going to be like travelling into the central part of the city and being on a packed tube train and next to people that might present a safety risk",This is one of the issues the government faces,rephrase
We have the example of other countries ahead of us,Which is helpful,rephrase
"Every director of a company, every employer knows their responsibility towards keeping their employees safe",It is crystal clear,rephrase
it is the few,It is not that many in my experience,rephrase
what you actually need is leaders who think the welfare of their staff is by far the most important thing,certainly that's the way we act as our senior leadership team in our organisation,rephrase
What people discovered is once those social distancing measures were put in place.Â  Staff returned to work,Some returned from being in isolation,rephrase
What people discovered is once those social distancing measures were put in place.Â  Staff returned to work,Some returned because they were anxious but they learned these measures had been put in place and this reassured them,rephrase
"in Newcastle, which was the example that was used, you do have a flare-up,",was the example that was used,rephrase
what we need to do is we also need to say there is evidence that clearly black men are unfortunately more vulnerable in this situation,until we get to the point where we have got another science to understand why this is really happening,rephrase
we need to be risk assessing our workplaces,We need to be looking at what's required in terms of distancing,rephrase
We need to be looking at what's required in terms of distancing,"whether it is screens, supplying any appropriate personal protective equipment",rephrase
we need to be risk assessing our workplaces,alongside that we absolutely need an enforcement of these guidelines,rephrase
"If that is the case, then we can have confidence going forward that people do feel safe going to work",employers as well feel safe over what they are required to do,rephrase
alongside that we absolutely need an enforcement of these guidelines,There are local authorities as well,rephrase
"George, apparent success.Â  Is that how you describe it",what did you think when the Prime Minister talked about our response to the pandemic as our apparent success,rephrase
Different countries are recording deaths in different ways,"For example, there is not a single universal way of recording Coronavirus and none Coronavirus",rephrase
you'll have heard what we can't do,You'll have heard the Defence Secretary explain over the last few days why NATO is not going to stand up a no-fly zone which a lot of people are asking for,rephrase
they put some red lines in place in NATO to ensure that the situation is not going to escalate,they don't want to do is for any NATO troops or aircraft to come into contact or combat with Russian forces,rephrase
You'll have heard the Defence Secretary explain over the last few days why NATO is not going to stand up a no-fly zone which a lot of people are asking for,he's outlined why that would be very difficult to do,rephrase
"Firstly, they want us to prevent civilian casualties",and I'm afraid there is likely to be many more of them,rephrase
"and, secondly, they're testing those red lines that NATO has put in place","Putting it provocatively, they want to know why we'll stand by Ukraine's flag, but not with their soldiers",rephrase
Putin's war has to be finished on Ukrainian soil,we must ensure that this ends in Ukraine,rephrase
"there will be other things, and one of the most important things finally that we can do is send a message to Russian troops",our message to them should be do the brave thing as your comrades have done,rephrase
put down your arms,Do not slaughter women and children,rephrase
there isn't anything else we can do for Ukraine,Ukraine will pay the price,rephrase
"and, secondly, they're testing those red lines that NATO has put in place",they put some red lines in place in NATO to ensure that the situation is not going to escalate,rephrase
we've done absolutely nothing about it,the West has given up trying to do anything about it,rephrase
the West has given up trying to do anything about it,this goes back to 2010 when there was a big Defence Review,rephrase
this is exactly why NATO are wading in now and saying we have to have a no-fly zone,they're concerned that it will be turned into a nuclear war,rephrase
It looks like there is a hint this is an area where both could agree on something,They say they'll need more talks to talk about how it would happen,rephrase
"when I speak to them, they say how grateful they are to people in Britain for everything that you're doing and for the moral support that your country is providing",thank you on behalf of everybody there,rephrase
"We have been, for many years, training and providing equipment to Ukrainian armed forces",I led one of the early training missions to do that,rephrase
"It is terrible when you hear members of NATO say, ""We're not going to go in and fight""","It is a very unusual thing for nations to do, to take the threat of armed forces off the table as NATO has done",rephrase
"this man called Sergey Naryshkin who is his foreign spy chief, he stuttered and looked shocked",didn't look like he was getting his answer right,rephrase
I would never have believed it,I never thought I would see Russians invading Ukraine,rephrase
I never thought I would see Russians invading Ukraine,"I never thought I'd see an international boycott, driven not just by governments and organisations, but by ordinary people",rephrase
I would never have believed it,"It happened so, so fast and spread so quickly",rephrase
"Today, they're parading on television",they've got their message in a row,rephrase
they've got their message in a row,they're lining up behind the Russian president,rephrase
Not everyone doesn't want war,There is one person who does want war,rephrase
There is one person who does want war,that is Putin,rephrase
"He has had many opportunities to negotiate, bilaterally, multi-laterally",there are institutions in the world from the UN downwards that there are that arbitrate such issues,rephrase
there are ways to make sure that everybody wins at that negotiation,this is what I have been warning people in the west about,rephrase
There is no way back into the international community,there is no way back for Russia to be welcomed,rephrase
"At the end of the day, this will end in a negotiation",that's unpleasant for people to hear,rephrase
"At the end of the day, this will end in a negotiation",The only way for us to get to the negotiating table is for the Ukrainians to put up a fight that's strong enough that Putin wants to come to the negotiating table,rephrase
"the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill is still being promoted by the Government",which would make those same peaceful protests illegal in this country,rephrase
understand that everybody has security concerns,we have to listen to each other,rephrase
we need to be honest,understand that everybody has security concerns,rephrase
For a long time we have been saying that Putin is going to invade Ukraine,it almost became a fait accompli,rephrase
there are young Russian soldiers who either give themselves up or are captured,you've probably seen on social media,rephrase
"When I listen to the mother, what the parent is hearing from those soldiers, they are bewildered and wary","they're wondering if this is Ukrainian propaganda, a sort of stitch-up",rephrase
"What else do you think could be done other than the information war, so to speak, that could deter him, change his mind",Change course,rephrase
we don't know what it is going to do,whether there is some massive onslaught coming,rephrase
"they're wondering if this is Ukrainian propaganda, a sort of stitch-up",you can understand that when they're being told this is being fabricated,rephrase
there are young Russian soldiers who either give themselves up or are captured,"they're given cups of tea and a pancake and asked, ""Do you want to phone your mum""",rephrase
We're clutching at straws here in the face of the bombardment of these Ukrainian towns and cities and that long column outside Kyiv,there are straws,rephrase
"the best case scenario would be, the war stopping at Ukraine",Some sort of peace or something,rephrase
"the best case scenario would be, the war stopping at Ukraine",Some sort of talking to Putin,rephrase
"If that doesn't happen, if the war escalates from Ukraine, what are we going to do next",do we have a Plan B,rephrase
Are we at risk at looking back on this in time and thinking that we're just a bystander,"if we let this happen, just purely as a bystander, we have seen in history what that can lead to",rephrase
We have to deal with the real politic of this,the real politic is Ukrainians are going to have to put up a fight,rephrase
the real politic is Ukrainians are going to have to put up a fight,they're going to have to get to the negotiating table,rephrase
they're going to have to get to the negotiating table,they're going to have to give away things that they don't care about which is Crimea and the two eastern regions,rephrase
so that country cannot be invaded again,More pieces cannot be bitting off it,rephrase
None of that is going to happen,I agree with what Konstantin Kisin said,rephrase
He has been sabre-rattling for the last couple of decades,the West has just let him get away with it,rephrase
"that would be, I think, in his interests and clearly, it would be in the Ukrainian president's interest to try and get all those vulnerable people out who would like to leave, who are desperate to leave",There's that human angle that Bridget talked about,rephrase
we certainly could do a great deal more there than we are doing at the moment,I hope that the UK government will move its position in terms of refugees,rephrase
we can do better,we must do better,rephrase
I know my country's history,"It has been really, really hard",rephrase
We have had the nuclear deterrent for 50 years and it has kept us safe,The threats that are being talked about now are the same that we have endured over those last 50 years,rephrase
"and still there are 7,000 more soldiers to go",to be cut from today forward by this Government,rephrase
"We have fewer ships, fewer sailors and fewer soldiers than this country has had for 300 years",That's the scale of cutbacks we've had,rephrase
This is about the situation on the ground in Ukraine that has to be dealt with,It is nothing to do with what we say here on this panel,rephrase
He has been demanding this for years,He has been arguing to get them sent back to Russia,rephrase
We may start to see some figures who sat on the fence and they moved their family to Britain and a lot of their personal wealth and they bought nice houses in Weybridge,they still done business in Russia and gone along to the big Kremlin meetings with Mr Putin that happened recently,rephrase
They're going to have to make a choice,Some are on the sanctions list,rephrase
"who is, you know, bringing the worst kind of destruction to the people of Ukraine",we can all see,rephrase
we can all see,that's the thing with modern day communications. We can see with our own eyes,rephrase
Some of the things that are happening need to be amplified and moved on faster,there needs to be significantly more movement there,rephrase
"We need to make it as uncomfortable as possible for the people who are at the top, the people who are propping Putin up","whatever else we do, we should not be giving them and him an easy ride",rephrase
the UK government has denied to accept refugees from the Ukraine,Is that true,rephrase
This is government in action,It is democracy in action,rephrase
It is democracy in action,"Agree, disagree, we can speak in public",rephrase
This is a strength,not a weakness,rephrase
"The point you're making, it is about Tory cuts",it is nonsense,rephrase
People in Russia don't watch BBC Question Time,They watch Russian national television,rephrase
They watch Russian national television,That's how most Russians get their news,rephrase
"when people don't think what they're hearing on the state media quite adds up, they will look for other sources of information",people will talk to each other,rephrase
people will talk to each other,They'll swap notes,rephrase
the British Government has commended Russians who are peacefully protesting in Moscow,often at the risk of being arrested,rephrase
the truth is there is nothing we can do,there isn't anything else we can do for Ukraine,rephrase
We're doing a huge amount,we haven't just been doing this recently,rephrase
we haven't just been doing this recently,we've been doing it for years,rephrase
we've been doing it for years,We've been supplying weapons,rephrase
We're doing a huge amount,we're training Ukrainian armed forces,rephrase
What's our Plan B,in terms of a Plan B,rephrase
I've always argued for strong defence spending,we should be doing that,rephrase
there is a great deal that needs to be done as part of that,"in Scotland, we're ready to do that",rephrase
We're open to refugees and we welcome them coming,We would support people to come here,rephrase
We should have a policy,We need to have a policy,rephrase
I've worked in situations like this,I was an aid worker in the Balkans,rephrase
I'm suggesting we have a system that gives emergency protection to everyone who needs it to come here,We need to have a policy,rephrase
So someone crosses the border and comes into Poland and at that point there would be a check,That's what you're suggesting,rephrase
That's what you're suggesting,"There could be a check, to check out who they are and make sure where they're settling so we'd make sure who is coming in and any support needs that people have when they come here",rephrase
This could be done in a heartbeat,It is swift,rephrase
What you can't have is what we have at the moment where you have at the minister immigration saying you can come here if you work in our fields doing manual labour,That is one of the routes that the Government are promoting at the moment,rephrase
Vladimir Putin explained this is one of the reasons he's invading Ukraine,Is there anyone on the panel who thinks that's legitimate and we might not be in the situation we're in now had that not taken place,rephrase
for the reasons people set out,What is happening for people to cross that border into safety is very different from them moving on to another nation,rephrase
What is happening for people to cross that border into safety is very different from them moving on to another nation,what is actually happening is very responsive to people's needs as they cross that border,rephrase
"in Kyiv, there has been an operation there to get visas for people already in operation and that's moved to another city further west","it is still going on in Ukraine, our staff are still there processing that",rephrase
what is actually happening is very responsive to people's needs as they cross that border,"in Kyiv, there has been an operation there to get visas for people already in operation and that's moved to another city further west",rephrase
"we can supply ammunition and weapons and, but this is a fight the Ukrainians have to win",The only way for us to get to the negotiating table is for the Ukrainians to put up a fight that's strong enough that Putin wants to come to the negotiating table,rephrase
"we can supply ammunition and weapons and, but this is a fight the Ukrainians have to win",we can provide support to Ukraine,rephrase
We gave it all up,don't pontificate about giving up the nuclear deterrent when they did it,rephrase
we're going to have a very difficult conversation about that,NATO and the United States in particular,rephrase
It is a really serious point actually,it is a valid question to ask,rephrase
the prospect of any country having weapons of mass destruction is perhaps one that we should reflect on and think again about,Certainly in Scotland there is a significant body of support for us not to have nuclear weapons,rephrase
not every Ukrainian wants to come to the UK,A lot of them would love to come back to Ukraine,rephrase
We need to have a calibrated response,Just saying we must throw the borders open to anyone who wants to come isn't going to solve the problem,rephrase
you'll disrupt the fabric of this society,people have made that point,rephrase
we can be generous and provide finance and other things in place to support people locally,There is a way to deal with this locally as that will be better for the people who we're talking about,rephrase
We've got to make sure that we provide everything we possibly can to people who need it,it does not necessarily have to be done by bringing people here in huge numbers,rephrase
That's not the reality that people are facing and people who are fleeing from this terrible war which we have all seen played out before our eyes are in the most desperate situation,They shouldn't face any barriers going to safety or to coming and being in a place of safety,rephrase
We need to do the right thing and don't rely on other countries to take up the slack,It is important that we step up here and we take our place doing the right thing and supporting the people that are fleeing,rephrase
what everybody wanted was a TV,They wanted a TV,rephrase
That is something that should really give us all pause for thought,"the circumstances now, compared to the Cold War, are very, very different",rephrase
It is going to require a degree of statescraft on behalf of our country,collectively on behalf of our us and our partners,rephrase
collectively on behalf of our us and our partners,particularly NATO,rephrase
This isn't just Ukraine,other war-torn countries this happens repeatedly,rephrase
too often it falls on the wrong side,It falls on the wrong side of that line,rephrase
I broadly agree with him in terms of the visa,of the situation,rephrase
I understand there is two schemes,One where there needs to be a family link and one where you need to be sponsored by a business or charity,rephrase
I don't want to give people the impression that they can't come across the border and get the assistance that they need,but I don't want people to take away a message that people can't do that,rephrase
That is our history,"That is our recent history with Afghanistan, with Hong Kong",rephrase
One where there needs to be a family link and one where you need to be sponsored by a business or charity,"You need to be sponsored by a business, individual or charity",rephrase
"It is right that NATO, with the help of Britain and Britain playing a leading role is moving forces to reinforce the new boundaries",the new borders that are being drawn in Europe,rephrase
"If we didn't have nuclear weapons, where would the troops be today",The only reason they're still in Ukraine and not in Poland is that we have nuclear weapons,rephrase
there would be people around him who would think he's crazy,there will be people who will try to stop him,rephrase
"In Russia, human life has a different value than in the West",The rational for making these decisions is different,rephrase
The Russian attitude to human life is that it is less valuable,Individuals are less sacrosanct,rephrase
If he thought the war wasn't going his way,NATO got involved,rephrase
I was interviewing a British historian about this today,"He made the point if you go to the memorial to Soviet soldiers in Berlin, these are people who defeated Nazis and they are great heroes and they're buried in mass graves",rephrase
They didn't have the dignity of being buried in their own grave,That's the attitude,rephrase
That's the attitude,That's how it has always been,rephrase
This is one of the things people in the West don't understand,people in that part of the world have a very different moral framework for making these decisions,rephrase
"using nuclear weapons is also a self-destruct button, isn't it",The question was if pushed,rephrase
"What you're saying, leaders in Russia have been cavalier",if they're thinking about their own survival,rephrase
Does Putin's high alert order make an attack likely,Is there a chain of command,rephrase
Is there a chain of command,do the Russians have rules for nuclear launches,rephrase
do the Russians have rules for nuclear launches,Does anyone on the panel know the answer to that question,rephrase
Does anyone on the panel know the answer to that question,"As former Defence Secretary, what can you tell us",rephrase
We use it every single hour of every single day,we have done for the last 50 years,rephrase
it underlines why nuclear weapons have no place,certainly down my road,rephrase
certainly down my road,not down your road either,rephrase
it underlines why nuclear weapons have no place,There is no place for nuclear weapons in the world,rephrase
It has seen us through some very difficult times,We use it every single hour of every single day,rephrase
My message would be not to be afraid,my message to you is don't be afraid,rephrase
don't we admire them,we would be lucky to have those actually,rephrase
We have NHS crisis,We have so many jobs on the list,rephrase
We have so many jobs on the list,We can support,rephrase
I come in here and I have no English,"I have a little bit, but not",rephrase
what's the Government's plan once the Ukrainians do come,What's the Government plans to re-house them and reintegrate them into society,rephrase
We have the Afghan refugee system,There are systems in place to sort out housing through local authorities,rephrase
all of us are going to be facing these price rises going up,"We're all going to be horrified when our council tax, our energy bills, not just tomorrow, but in October as well, goes sky high",rephrase
there are millions of families that don't have that option,They simply do not have the money,rephrase
This is the wrong time,It's the wrong tax at the wrong time,rephrase
"the difference that's going to make to people's household incomes, it's going to take an extra Â£2,600 in total away from people",People cannot afford that at a time like this,rephrase
That's profits in excess of what they had planned to be making,It wasn't earmarked for investment,rephrase
It wasn't earmarked for investment,This is money they didn't expect to be getting,rephrase
that are making something like in excess of Â£3bn surplus profits,A windfall tax on that could take that money and subsidise household incomes at this crucial moment for family finances,rephrase
A windfall tax on that could take that money and subsidise household incomes at this crucial moment for family finances,up to Â£600 off your bill for the most vulnerable families,rephrase
That would be far more effective than the Â£200 loan,that the Wonga Chancellor is making everybody take out and then pay back whether you want it or not,rephrase
They haven't got the means to do it,They haven't got savings,rephrase
there needs to be help,"whether that is just a cut on the tax for people in that circumstance or whether it's extra benefits or it's extra help, just one off payments, something needs to be done",rephrase
Part of the reason we're in this problem is that we've seen the collapse in investment right now,one of the reasons energy prices have soared is that we haven't been investing enough in energy,rephrase
"We need more investment in renewables, more renewables investment in infrastructure, batteries",all of the things that we need as part of that transition,rephrase
we are going to need gas for a while as that transition happens,For decades,rephrase
This is children that are suffering and not having food,"More and more professional people, nurses, doctors, professional people are using food banks",rephrase
People need help now,"Not in the future, they need it now, right now",rephrase
We need energy,"Crucially, more than anything else, we need energy that is affordable, that is reliable and that is secure",rephrase
"yes, that means building nuclear power stations",it means fracking for the gas under our feet,rephrase
it means fracking for the gas under our feet,It means actually planning for the future,rephrase
"Crucially, more than anything else, we need energy that is affordable, that is reliable and that is secure",we need to have all of those three things,rephrase
the Shadow Chancellor have confirmed this morning that's only for a third of households,it's not for every household,rephrase
the Shadow Chancellor have confirmed this morning that's only for a third of households,The national insurance threshold will improve the outlook for 70% of households,rephrase
Labour are naive,Labour are naive if they think energy companies won't then pass that tax onto their customers,rephrase
"those energy companies, if we want to invest in our energy for the future, will need that money to invest",whether it's in renewables or whether it's in fossil fuels in the short term,rephrase
he has increased the universal credit taper,He did that before the spring statement,rephrase
Why do you think the Chancellor didn't increase benefits,Benefits will go up by three per cent,rephrase
"But you know what inflation is now, I mean it's over six per cent","By the end of the year inflation could be nine per cent, ten per cent",rephrase
for the longer term we should be investing in renewables,"Wind, wave power, retrofitting our homes",rephrase
you're talking about the price cap coming off tomorrow,You're talking about people on average seeing a Â£700 increase in their energy costs tomorrow,rephrase
"You're talking about if you live off grid, which many people do in the North of Scotland for example",They buy heating oil,rephrase
I checked the price tonight,The price has gone up from 44p a litre a year ago to Â£1.18,rephrase
This is a massive crisis,most people haven't lived through the kind of inflation that we're seeing unless you were around in the 1970s as some of us were,rephrase
"Wind, wave power, retrofitting our homes","So, so much we could do to really get our sustainability levels up",rephrase
the energy price cap,which has up until now saved households around Â£700 a year on fuel prices,rephrase
We are altering the universal credit taper,"which will again bring in around Â£1,000 a year for the lowest paid households",rephrase
We have lifted the national insurance threshold,that will improve the income for about 70% of households by about Â£300 a year,rephrase
And that's been weighted disproportionately to higher income people,and he's not doing very much for those at the bottom,rephrase
We could increase over the next 25 years our green energy in Scotland about fivefold from where we currently are. We can fill that gap,We can make sure that we can deliver safe and cheaply the green energy that we need,rephrase
"you're part of the problem, madam",this move towards net zero in a randomly plucked date in 2050,rephrase
this move towards net zero in a randomly plucked date in 2050,which by the way was decided by Parliament after a 90 minute debate,rephrase
which by the way was decided by Parliament after a 90 minute debate,I've spent longer choosing socks than that,rephrase
It's not about a date,It's about a reduction in global atmospheric carbon emissions to reduce a global temperature rise,rephrase
in the best possible outcome we are going to need fossil fuels for that transition,We're going to need particularly natural gas,rephrase
which is a fuel,which is an important transition fuel,rephrase
"in terms of what's been said about supporting Ukraine, absolutely",we absolutely will be standing with Ukraine and we'll see what happens,rephrase
it's around actions that he needs to be judged,actions speak louder than works,rephrase
"what's just stunning when you're there is how this entire country has come together, led by the president","it's all of the people in the country determined, absolutely determined to face this invasion",rephrase
they need more weapons,They need more weapons to be able to do this,rephrase
It has less than one per cent of impact,Our contribution to global warming from our country is one per cent of carbon emissions,rephrase
It's a global effort,This is a global problem and it's not about individual targets,rephrase
It's a global effort,"It's about everyone working together to reduce atmospheric carbon, to reduce the rise in temperature",rephrase
"we don't see a further escalation of ecosystem collapse around the world, increases in volatility of weather patterns, flooding, forest fires, refugee crises, people moving",Climate change is a huge disaster,rephrase
"we've got to look at the reality that the Russian bombing, Putin's bombing is going on","let's not forget out of this, that this is an act of aggression against the Ukrainian people by Putin and his regime",rephrase
at the end of this he and his regime must face the international court,They must be held accountable for the war crimes that are taking place,rephrase
who would've thought that after the end of the Second World War that we're facing war in Europe,the scenes that we're seeing nightly on our television screens are completely unacceptable,rephrase
"there is a cross-party consensus and I'm glad there is, that we must do everything that we can to support Ukraine",We must make sure that we get defensive weapons into them,rephrase
We must make sure that we get defensive weapons into them,We must make sure that we're providing humanitarian help,rephrase
we should be saluting Zelensky for the leadership he has given,the solidarity that he has had from his people,rephrase

Like who?,Which countries?,rephrase
"I'd like to see my Government put more pressure on the UK businesses like Marks and Spencers that still have franchises out in Russia, KFC, places like that",You need to put more pressure on them to stop them and close them down over in Russia,rephrase
"take what the Russians are saying very, very sceptically","in Kyiv they're taking that very, very sceptically",rephrase
"they have clearly, more than a month into this, failed in what they thought they would do and what most people thought they would do",was be able to roll into Kyiv within 72 hours.,rephrase
you've just come back from Ukraine where you interviewed President Zelensky,I was there,rephrase
We've got a minister saying that we're going to help Ukraine as much as possible,"Last week there was a lot of talk about yes, we're speeding up the process, we're doing everything we can to help them",rephrase
we still are seeing really low numbers of refugees being allowed into this country,we're still seeing disastrous numbers of people actually being allowed,rephrase
"the Government shelved a couple of years ago the Russia report, put together by the House of Commons own intelligence and security committee that told us that our politics, our business, our finance was far too open to dirty money linked to the Kremlin with not enough questions being asked",If we had acted then to cut that off it would've stemmed the flow of money that pays for Putin's war machine,rephrase
You're not suggesting it would've stopped President Putin invading Ukraine,It would have stopped a lot of the money that he's using to arm his troops in those circumstances,rephrase
learn some of the lessons from what we've done in Scotland,We've increased social security spending where we have control of our spending by six per cent in Scotland,rephrase
the idea that this woman is able to get together all the amount of paperwork that you need to get a visa to the UK was completely ludicrous,She just couldn't,rephrase
I came back through the same way,I came back from the Ukrainian side into the Polish side,rephrase
"It was dimmed, it was full of people, it had that acrid smell, the smell of people who haven't been able to wash",People who have lots and lots of people living in that station,rephrase
"The Ukrainians are negotiating now to be a neutral country, and are making a commitment not to join NATO","I just wonder going back to that point about the 20th century, if that stance had been taken before the war, whether we would even be in a war now",rephrase
"I just wonder going back to that point about the 20th century, if that stance had been taken before the war, whether we would even be in a war now","what they are negotiating, what they want, is to have a security guarantee as part of their neutrality",rephrase
we need to start moving away from thinking that they are somehow not getting something they want by not being part of NATO,They will want to have some kind of security guarantee,rephrase
Vladimir Putin told us he was going to do it,he amassed the troops,rephrase
in the West we did nothing,Zilch,rephrase
in the West we did nothing,Nothing in terms of to actually deter him from doing that,rephrase
If we had acted sooner,if NATO troops had gone to the border,rephrase
if NATO troops had gone to the border,if we had said you can come in and you can be an associate member of NATO,rephrase
if we had said you can come in and you can be an associate member of NATO,one steel toecap of a Russian soldier into Ukrainian territory and we will act,rephrase
Did the West not notice,Did we just not notice that,rephrase
we barely acted,"A few little sanctions here, a few sanctions there",rephrase
Did we just not notice that,we barely acted,rephrase
we all certainly hope that the Ukrainians will be victorious,largely actually thanks to help training and military hardware from this country,rephrase

you think about what has been said about the way in which the MP for Bury south was being treated,that's an insult to the people of Bury south as well,rephrase
"We then need to have a focused amount on the squeezed middle, with the elderly",Where we help them with bills as well,rephrase
"They're not the creators of the energy, they are the ones whether sell it",I'm talking about more upstream than that,rephrase
helping with the engineer costs would be a huge help,If we were in power we would say that they should,rephrase
That's the point,"That you go upstream where they are making the money, you get a windfall tax from them, then you start we district",rephrase
the way we calculate increases is grossly unfair,It is tipped toward the wealthier end of the spectrum,rephrase
It is tipped toward the wealthier end of the spectrum,This is hitting the poorest in society the hardest,rephrase
He has his own mandate from the mechanics of the squish unionist party,that is not in the equation whatsoever,rephrase
"Yes, they do",They leave two,rephrase
the politicians who we trusted to lead our country have basically resorted to childish name calling,It is that that bothers me,rephrase
Whenever the SNP stand up at other times and labour walk out,It is awful behaviour,rephrase
How do you dividend that,how do you get on board with the fact that your party is behaving in that kind of fashion,rephrase
they are so preoccupied fighting themselves,"they are spending so much time, with respect, fighting one another",rephrase
This week on Monday it was announced that the Treasury was going to write off 4.2 billion of fraud from COVID loans,they are going to write off 4.3 billion,rephrase
Is that is 10 percent of the Scottish bloc grant next-year,That is almost the same amount as the 5 mill I do not know that the secretary of health announced was being given to the national health on its recovery path,rephrase
they are going to write off 4.3 billion,we are going to write it off,rephrase
They think they will get a billion back in the next year at the cost to us of 100 million,that's whether or not it is going to cost us,rephrase
They will have a baby box waiting for them with essentials for the fist six months of life,"By the time they go to primary school they will have a free school meal, support with music and art, support with school trips",rephrase
"By the time they go to primary school they will have a free school meal, support with music and art, support with school trips",When they go to high school they will have greater chance than ever before of getting a higher pass and an advanced higher pass,rephrase
"It isn't free, we have to pay for it",It is funded,rephrase
When they go to high school they will have greater chance than ever before of getting a higher pass and an advanced higher pass,Should they decide they want to go to university they will do so on the ability to learn not the ability to pay,rephrase
rail prices are criminal in the UK,the fact that the most sustainable mode of transport is also the most expensive doesn't make any sense,rephrase
like everyone else I have seen the projected costs in engineer bills,it is pretty horrific,rephrase
"is this a short sharp Joel or in this hopefully post-COVID, post-Brexit, tensions with Russia and Eastern Europe",is this going to be the new normal,rephrase
We have the Scottish land fund,that's about empowering communities to take control of their aspects and decide what they want to do with them,rephrase
We don't have enough homes in Britain,That's what the problem is,rephrase
they don't see the results,sometimes within the term they are in power,rephrase
We need to build more houses,We need to build more flats,rephrase
"I grew up there and would saw how as a young person, determined to make my life and career in those areas, there are so many pressures which can make you give up and move to elsewhere",It is access to jobs,rephrase
"I grew up there and would saw how as a young person, determined to make my life and career in those areas, there are so many pressures which can make you give up and move to elsewhere",it is access to services,rephrase
"I grew up there and would saw how as a young person, determined to make my life and career in those areas, there are so many pressures which can make you give up and move to elsewhere",it is the availability and affordability of housing,rephrase
What would you do about it,What are you going to do,rephrase
I'm very concerned about the failure to replace the social housing that was lost in places like St Andrews through the right to buy policy of the '80s,it hasn't been replaced,rephrase
this is where local planning policies need to be more sensitive,this for me is about ongoing dialogue rather than putting in place strict caps on how the market operates,rephrase
My wife and I have four children and it we have watched them in their struggle to get on the property ladder,We have done everything we can to help them,rephrase
"Wall Street Journal, because of rising prices, because of the nonavailability of suitable properties, that is very difficult",We need to do something about that,rephrase
We need to build more homes,"we need to build more homes, generally, of all sorts",rephrase
I would rather deal with the root issues,The root issue is there aren't enough homes in Scotland,rephrase
One of the ideas that I think we need to develop is the idea of compulsory sales orders,"you have pieces of landlord, properties that are derelict or not being used productivel",rephrase
"I personally -- this is not Labour policy, but I would put a cap, happily, on second homes",this is not Labour policy,rephrase
"I don't know if many people know the statistics of this town, people like me, there's 7,500 of us, 11,000 students",I don't know if the gentleman at the end was aware of that,rephrase
"I don't know if many people know the statistics of this town, people like me, there's 7,500 of us, 11,000 students",That's a shocking statistic,rephrase
When we were 21 we got married,That was the end of me being able to live here with my parents,rephrase
That was the end of me being able to live here with my parents,"I had to move out, 10 miles away",rephrase
Emily's Scotland brief needs to be updated,That's what I'm asking,rephrase
It is all words,"It is blah, blah, blah",rephrase
What the SNP do is set their political priorities,Their political priorities do not include supporting the services provided by local government,rephrase
My roots were pulled up,"and my children, who are not children now, have had to do the same",rephrase
You cannot have houses of multiple occupation,That was Fife counsel that brought that out,rephrase
We don't have any improvements,there's no improvement in poverty,rephrase
why is it that we have a devolved government that has all of this money given from the UK government and they cannot seem to solve any of these problems,"Suicide, drugs, addictions, you know, the health, the roads, transport, everything, it just -- what is it",rephrase
You just need to go out in the roads around here and you could play 18 holes going down the street,You don't have to go to the old course for that,rephrase
We don't have any improvements,It is absolutely shocking,rephrase
What are they actually doing,I'm not just blaming the SNP for this,rephrase
We don't have any improvements,nothing is improving,rephrase
I'm absolutely open to that,I'm not going to enter into a discussion about the demise of Northern Ireland,rephrase
I'm not going to enter into a discussion about the demise of Northern Ireland,the abolishing of Northern Ireland,rephrase
more and more people in Northern Ireland no longer define themselves as Unionist or nationalist,It isn't the priority of a lot of people,rephrase
our passion is about making a better future for all of our people,"United Kingdom or united Ireland, I want to see a united society here in Northern Ireland and one that flourishes",rephrase
We've got to ask ourselves whether the St Andrew's Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement reflects the reality of politics of Northern Ireland in this three-way split,The question is a really good one,rephrase
The question is now the time for us to consider what a future united Ireland should look like,Every day is the day that people consider these things,rephrase
the union is a force for good within all parts of the United Kingdom,together a force for good around the world,rephrase
it looks quite repulsive,the person and the people running government are repulsive,rephrase
that we make Westminster deliver for all parts of the union,particularly here in Northern Ireland,rephrase
The really important thing about what we learned about Boris Johnson's behaviour throughout the pandemic,is that he lies,rephrase
The really important thing about what we learned about Boris Johnson's behaviour throughout the pandemic,"He is reckless, and that he is incompetent",rephrase
"what we see in the Sue Gray Report, what we now know for fact about the behaviour and the way that our leader of our country works, is actually having a massive impact","what we now know for fact about the behaviour and the way that our leader of our country works, is actually having a massive impact",rephrase
not just on the culture in Number 10,the way that our country is being run and perceived as a country around the world,rephrase
it has to be a yes regardless of your political stripe,"Yes, to a united Ireland",rephrase
"Yes, to a united Ireland",I'm a soft Unionist,rephrase
We want to see the conversation,which has already taken place,rephrase
which has already taken place,the fact that you're asking the question is proof of that,rephrase
We've called on the British government to clarify that term in the Good Friday Agreement,what would actually trigger such referendums on this island,rephrase
I want to see a stronger United Kingdom where everybody feels comfortable,that works for everybody,rephrase
"the school laptops, for example, our school our disadvantage laptops still havenât arrived",the implementation of some of the policies that the government have suggested havenât necessarily turned out to what they were planned,inference
health professionals are increasingly worried that this is having a real impact on childrenâs mental health as well,Itâs not just about exam results and life chances,inference
the apology by Keir Starmer on behalf of the CPS as DPP precisely parallels the apology of the Prime Minister on behalf of Number 10,she's mistaken,inference
In fact what's really terrible is this week they had an opportunity to vote with us to provide a solution to the issue a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies,This Government is not doing enough,inference
"who have done really, really well out of the situation",In fact what's really terrible is this week they had an opportunity to vote with us to provide a solution to the issue a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies,inference
"who have done really, really well out of the situation",It's important it goes back in the pockets of consumers,inference
now they are going to be seeing these energy hikes,it's so disappointing for working families up and down the country,inference
He lied to Parliament,this mess which is frankly of the Prime Minister's making,inference
overzealous,there are social and economic costs we are now paying,inference
It sounds incredibly moving if you have got people,I completely understand why you have done it,inference
you really are being fair about the conduct of Number 10,you can't fairly put those circumstances alongside each other,inference
I'm seeing toddlers coming in Zoe with scalds over their bodies because water bottles have burst because their families cannot pay the bills.,This Government is not doing enough,inference
I have spoken to doctors and nurses who have to suffer the moral harm of watching someone die who didn't have to die because they weren't vaccinated,I know,inference
I have spoken to doctors and nurses who have to suffer the moral harm of watching someone die who didn't have to die because they weren't vaccinated,we have to keep trying,inference
respect the choices,we have to respect people,inference
"As a medical student, I have seen up and down the country different patients with different reasons saying they don't want to get vaccinated",the pregnant population need to be targeted and highlighted here,inference
and the swine flu vaccine was recalled after 800 cases I believe of narcolepsy in children,There are far more cases of adverse reactions from this vaccine than the swine flu vaccine,inference
Yet I don't feel like there's an open conversation about the side effects,There are far more cases of adverse reactions from this vaccine than the swine flu vaccine,inference
I think they are two different issues,"I would like to start first with differentiating vaccines for healthcare workers, and vaccines for the general population",inference
because of Covid they hadn't been vaccinated,we need to work with people not against them,inference
"the levying of green and other social levies which are added on to your bills, something like 20% right now of your bill is those levies which have been applied by the Government",It distorts things,inference
That's what we do in this country,it makes sense for the Government to target over-target those people who are going to suffer the most,inference
"We have just, we are just coming out of the worst of the pandemic only to be faced by another pandemic in a way which is the pandemic of poverty",I am really concerned about the knock-on impacts on the NHS,inference
I remember all those things,we owe it to ourselves as a country to do things like give people back the 20 pounds a week we took off the poorest people,inference
one of them is the notion that Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people have been badly treated,they have very good reasons not to trust leadership,inference
you are poor,that makes no difference,inference
that makes no difference,let's suspend the dividends for a year,inference
we have our own oil and gas rather than import it from Eastern Europe,start investing in shell gas,inference
it's a way of saving some money,start investing in shell gas,inference
we have in abundance,start investing in shell gas,inference
"If you are poor, it doesn't have that impact",Probably not,inference
It's not just the energy bill,You can't just look at those bills on their own,inference
it will affect the poor more than the middle classes and the wealthy,Probably not,inference
what happened was inevitable,we did warn the Government,inference
you don't want to harm your patients,"Of course, it's important to take a vaccine",inference
you lose any more staff,it's also important to understand how essential proper staffing levels are,inference
there are no staff,"you are bringing your mum into the A&E, of a night, and she cannot get her stroke treatment within a four hour window",inference
"by spreading the virus, or putting them by undue stress",I can see no logical answer for somebody who wants to make sure that they are not potentially harming individuals,inference
the actual evidence for the safety of the vaccine and its efficacy in the healthcare setting is so overwhelming,The way to persuade them is probably not through making it mandated,inference
science is all about questioning the evidence,I have great respect particularly for people who have questioned,inference
They don't all have the same side effects,one thing is really important to recognise is there are a range of vaccines out there,inference
science is all about questioning the evidence,"Scientists spend their life, I spend my life looking at evidence and questioning it",inference
they have been in billions of people,We have far more safety databased on the current vaccines,inference
you have lent it to the Government,the Government shouldn't be lending it to you,inference
you have lent it to the Government,it's not it's yours,inference
the Government were sensible,they would be using the gas crisis as an opportunity to retrofit a lot of the homes in the UK,inference
to reduce the demand for gas,they would be using the gas crisis as an opportunity to retrofit a lot of the homes in the UK,inference
I live in my body and I know how my body works,I'm best informed to know how I thought I may fight Covid,inference
That's the reason why they are not taking the vaccine,we need to move away from this narrative of black and ethnic minorities or don't trust the Government,inference
"I have persuaded my family members who are vulnerable, who I deem vulnerable to take the vaccine",I'm not an anti-vaxxer,inference
when you go back to work people will look at you like you smell,some of my close friends said don't mention that you are not vaccinated,inference
some of my close friends said don't mention that you are not vaccinated,I was a bit hesitant to even speak about this subject tonight,inference
early on in Israel their green pass if you have had a positive test that counted,one thing which doesn't get discussed is natural immunity,inference
There's no secrecy around it,you can get those numbers,inference
"happens mainly in young men, and teenagers","it's extremely rare, very unlikely to happen",inference
The most people who have some adverse event are mild injection site reactions and maybe a day of feeling slightly unwell,they are extremely rare,inference
looking at it on a global basis,More than just The Yellow Card,inference
You are not just getting vaccinated to ensure your own health,So I think the issue here is it's not just about personal choice,inference
It only works where everybody contributes to reducing transmission in the community,It's about ensuring everybody else's health,inference
So if you were vaccinated you would be much less likely to get reinfected and much more less likely to pass it on to others,It's about ensuring everybody else's health,inference
We are all different individuals,So the difficulty with natural immunity is if you have had Covid you don't know how good an immune response you have developed,inference
because the vaccines are not perfect,and if you do become infected,inference
"So, in the context of vaccination, that will boost the response that you got from natural infection",and give you protection for much longer,inference
"So, in the context of vaccination, that will boost the response that you got from natural infection",and make you lose susceptible to become infected,inference
that involved for three months for three years in the winter time and I went round hospitals and around a trust and vaccinated staff with the flu vaccines,"I came across charge nurses who weren't black, they were you know, part of the trust who wouldn't have the vaccine",inference
that didn't work,I don't know how we expect to get anyone to come in to take more vaccines,inference
"When you look at Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) NHS staff, it's 69","there are things that we can, and should and are doing to encourage those staff to take up the vaccine",inference
you are going through your notes finding all sorts of other things,is nothing he says credible to you,inference
I studied philosophy at university,learned an appeal to authority is not an automatic win of an argument,inference
"The people who developed the vaccines, the two Rna vaccines are Biontech, the company invented RNA vaccines, and the other group are Moderna",It's based on their research,inference
It's based on their research,It's not based on individual,inference
"Whenever you impose something on people, and you take away bodily autonomy",I have to consider the dignity of the individual. And their right to refuse something to be done to them,inference
"what is the point of living, what is the value of life if not to be free",I am very reluctant to go down to continue down this path of telling people what to do,inference
That makes me very uncomfortable,I would rather live in a society that is free than live in one which curtails one liberties to that extent,inference
there's a state that is almost not worth living in,That makes me very uncomfortable,inference
"before I got Covid, I was very anxious about how will it affect me if I do get it",it is a difficult decision to make,inference
I'm someone who has not really experienced any sickness I'm pretty healthy,worried I might be sicker than I have been,inference
I don't get a cold or flu or headaches,I'm someone who has not really experienced any sickness I'm pretty healthy,inference
I tend to go to natural remedies,"actually as an individual, when I am going through pain, I tend not to if to those things",inference
they are worried if they get rid of him they will get hid of the one thing -- rid of the one thing that got them the election,They move against Boris Johnson at their risk,inference
he is an absolute consistent liar,He wasn't fit to lead the country before we went into the pandemic,inference
"We have to remember his track record of homophobia, racism, sexism, misogyny",He wasn't fit to lead the country before we went into the pandemic,inference
He doesn't care about us,There's absolutely no way he should stay,inference
missed five Cobra meetings,He doesn't care about us,inference
"it means people are again, likely to stay away from having vaccines","Until we start discussing this openly, I think the situation is going to continue as it is",inference
the consequence of that is more likely to be resistance than people going along with it,"in general in life, as far as you can, you should reason and argue and debate with people rather than imposing something on them",inference
It could,I wanted to do it,inference
"your risk from the vaccine, and the risk from the vaccine is so low to you, and the benefits are so high that it would boost your immune response","give you the security that those vulnerable members of your family who you have persuaded to get vaccines for very real reasons, you are not going to be passing on the virus to them",inference
It's more important than that,I just worry about it turning into a kind of game,inference
"It's about whether we have leadership which has a set of values and has a moral compass that can actually be an example to me, you and our children, and young people who want to enter politics",It's more important than that,inference
We have had Prime Ministers who have been paragons of morality like Theresa May and she was rubbish at the job,One shouldn't have to say integrity is important in public life,inference
the current situation it's only made it a lot harder to communicate the core messages that people need to hear,Who do you trust in terms to give you a truthful picture of the situation,inference
given the evidence that was available to ministers making that decision,they made the right decision about the care sector,inference
It's not the same for everybody person,You should try and explore that for people who just choose not to,inference
You should try and explore that for people who just choose not to,maybe that might be a solution to your NHS crisis,inference
His current Chief of Staff has just resigned,"There have been four or five resignations today, this evening",inference
We are seeing the media then cheerfully picking all this up,the stories are then coming out bit by bit,inference
the stories are then coming out bit by bit,You have to ask yourself whether or not we are being played here,inference
we are,we should understand the circumstances,inference
understandably extremely cross,none of that means that we shouldn't be conscious about the affect it has on people who have very properly followed the rules very precisely,inference
but there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates,I do think when I talk to my public health colleagues what they say to me is be very careful about making international comparisons at this point,inference
"For example, there is not a single universal way of recording Coronavirus and none Coronavirus",but there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates,inference
mistakes have been made,telling us clearly and transparently what they intend to do differently,inference
we have not got a grip on this,"we are experiencing, the number of people dying, the heart breaking scenarios of people dying alone often in unnecessary circumstances",inference
trust is quite important now,Until the government shows some integrity we can't begin to see how we can move forward,inference
the Coronavirus,I remember in February two local schools where I live in South London were closed,inference
"clearly we are at 30,000 deaths",It is a real issue,inference
we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,we are the worst in Europe,inference
"people who have stayed at home, observed social distancing, our fabulous NHS and everybody who responded to this crisis",the Prime Minister was describing there is what we have all done as a country,inference
It is right to acknowledge the steps people have taken,that's what the Prime Minister was doing,inference
It is a city with a big public transportation system,That could have had an impact early on,inference
Now we are dealing with this epidemic,here will be a time to reflect and learn lessons at the end of this,inference
It was occupying all of Matt Hancock's time,So lots and lots of planning and preparation went into responding to this,inference
"As soon as the advice was we should lockdown, that's exactly what we did",it was the case that the scientific advice was not that we should have locked down earlier than we did,inference
The idea is people will go on to the app,They will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way,inference
They will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way,If their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time,inference
If their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time,that person subsequently shows symptoms and reports those symptoms,inference
that person subsequently shows symptoms and reports those symptoms,those other people who have been in close or regular contact with that person will receive a notification to say that someone who they were in close contact with has reported symptoms,inference
they made us look good,initially we liked the comparisons,inference
now they make us look bad,we can't trust them,inference
"The definition of testing was changed when it emerged that we couldn't meet the 100,000 a day standard we were promised",The government has been changing its narrative to fit its results,inference
We deserve an honest acknowledgment of that,You feel the leadership has failed this,inference
I am afraid that hitting the target on 30th of April was done by putting a number of tests in the post without actual guarantee that those tests had been used,it's not got to that yet,inference
"the government has done hitting that 100,000 target by April 30th",we have not really quite got the geographic spread we need of testing,inference
we have not really quite got the geographic spread we need of testing,that will need to be ramped up,inference
the NHS needs to play its part,We need support also from the government,inference
They have to apply online,They are not getting them in time,inference
This potentially fails the NHS app standards for data protection,What assurances can the government give us in the data protection standards,inference
otherwise it won't work,as soon as you develop symptoms of Coronavirus you have to have that data on a database,inference
If they don't have symptoms,they wouldn't need to isolate for longer than that,inference
to work out precisely how this would work,This is why we are piloting it,inference
because it will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms,It could be very powerful,inference
because it will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms,We will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down,inference
It could be very powerful,This is why we are piloting it,inference
They have already resolved some of these problems,What I am a bit surprised about is we are not learning from countries that are further ahead of this,inference
we have two horses,we can get one of them to work very quickly,inference
we need to,we can get one of them to work very quickly,inference
the app is very much part of that,We have been arguing a strategy on this for some considerable time now,inference
At the moment nobody in the NHS knows what role they are meant to be playing to support the app,What we will need is the results of that pilot or trial in the Isle of Wight circulated very quickly,inference
George doesn't seem to be clear how it works,People need to know how it works,inference
They were too consumed about models and herd immunity,We were talking about why the government didn't have tests in place earlier,inference
We are not sure how it is going to work,it is being tried in the Isle of Wight,inference
This is something that may be coming the way of all of us,Let's understand how it works to be clear,inference
We don't know,This is why we are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,inference
"if people in the Isle of Wight are doing it, they must know what they should do",This must have been worked out,inference
"They have been very, very candid about the nature of this crisis, the reasons we are doing the things we are doing, very candid about the evidence and epidemiology behind it",We have been I think as frank as possible with the public,inference
"the NHS has actually created 33,000 beds to cater to Coronavirus patients",We have created 7 Nightingale Hospitals literally within the space of a fortnight,inference
shared with them all of our thinking,We have been I think as frank as possible with the public,inference
track and tracing is going to be successful,We have to help these tracers to get at least 70 to 90% success rate,inference
Then they can track if we have caught the virus to pinpoint where we have been and whom we have had contact with,To be a success it is essential that the authorities have access to our personal data,inference
with all of its capability,"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like ours, like Britain, with all of its capability we should have done better",inference
What you said in your question is we didn't plan ahead,Margaret's question is absolutely spot on,inference
We need this app and to be able to track and trace,we absolutely need this technology,inference
"This has been the strategy in countries that have managed this very successfully, in South Korea, for example",We need this app and to be able to track and trace,inference
It is going to have to be held centrally,you are going to pick up those different parts of the country where there are outbreaks,inference
We need to understand the two different apps actually have different ways in which the data is hemmed,we are missing something important here,inference
we are missing which feels important to me is one of the things about lockdown which is the consistent lack of national communications,we try to have different areas doing different things at different times,inference
Unlike some of those other apps you get better information about where you might get local flare ups,we are able to respond to that and monitor local or regional pick up in the virus,inference
we have to see this as what it is,We have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we have all made too many sacrifices,We have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we are trying to get out of lockdown to save the economy and jobs,it is certain you are desperate to get out of the house,inference
in the north we have seen high death rates in towns like Sunderland,I don't know if these should be managed in the same way as other parts of the country like the Northway,inference
"The guidelines, for example, are slightly different",There have been moments in the crisis where Wales have taken slightly different decisions,inference
we do all share these islands,that has been the sensible way to proceed,inference
Different at the moment but in ordinary circumstances they commute over the border,"It gets very difficult if you have things that are very, very different in different parts of the country",inference
"Some of us from the first anecdotal evidence of this, from the beginning have been asking for concerted evidence as to why certain ethnic groups appear to be so much at risk",There is an inquiry,inference
"so that everybody can have confidence, whether it is employers or employees","We have been working for a national safety standard and putting that together with employers, with the employees and of course across political parties",inference
clearly we are not out of the woods on this by any means,We are going to be very cautious,inference
We really need to trust the tracers to be able to meet that target to contain this virus of 70% to 90% of the people,we need to give the tracers as much information as possible,inference
you need a pretty significant take-up to get the information you want from it,Is it really going to be of any use,inference
Matt Hancock has set up this inquiry,It was taken seriously,inference
All of the agencies have been working and contributing to the guidance that businesses are following,Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency as well,inference
We want people to feel safe to return to work,That's why the government has been doing a lot of work over the last few weeks with unions and employers,inference
"Food manufacturers, diaries, meat producers, they have all managed to put in place social distancing measures",People going in April to supermarket see social distancing measures put in place,inference
"people who are vulnerable, who are too insecure to be able to challenge employers at work or depend on zero hours contracts, won't be protected",we need stringent measures that are not optional,inference
"people who are vulnerable, who are too insecure to be able to challenge employers at work or depend on zero hours contracts, won't be protected","We ought to be thinking about the worst case, not best case scenario",inference
That's actually created issues,What we also know is that life is now becoming really complex,inference
The retail sector is working and some other sectors are working,we learn from those,inference
we know we don't have a perfect record of safety at work,there are employers who will flout good practice,inference
if they are not,there are employers who will flout good practice,inference
If we were in a position where the government had been honest with us and taken all these concerns seriously from the beginning,it would be a lot easier to listen to proposed guidelines about returning to work,inference
there will always be employers who are not responsible and willing to put their workers at risk,we need a bit of reality,inference
"When we have talked to our staff about what might happen, things they immediately raised were what is it going to be like travelling into the central part of the city and being on a packed tube train and next to people that might present a safety risk",An example is we work in the centre of London,inference
This is one of the issues the government faces,We also need to ensure transport is appropriately configured,inference

that might well be my personal opinion as well,"As to your specific question about the mother, I would completely understand all your willingness for her to stay in prison for the rest of her life",inference
our society does not value or ask our politicians to value older people and vulnerable people that require care,the problem that this exposes is that social care has for too long been the poor relation of health generally in our society,inference
