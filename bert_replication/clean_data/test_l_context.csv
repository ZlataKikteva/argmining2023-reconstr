we can talk about say Dr Robert Malone who invented the vaccine No,I don't think he is the man who invented the vaccine,conflict
I take the point about the risk of passing it on to someone else or taking up a hospital bed These are sound moral questions that imply that taking the vaccine is the altruistic thing to do,I have to consider the dignity of the individual.

"The point I am making really is, of course, we will come to a point in the future when we must look very robustly with great scrutiny as to what the government is doing and what differently it could have done throughout this crisis We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have",at the same time we can't simply say this is something for the future,conflict

it's not the only strategy here We suggest let's do our trials in the Isle of Wight,"there might be a good idea to back another horse, which is the app that's being developed in Korea",conflict
We have been arguing a strategy on this for some considerable time now the app is very much part of that,"t is also true to say, though, it is going to require oversight",conflict
We don't know This is why we are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,This must have been worked out,conflict

"Are we saying that the diplomatic route is closed to Putin there are talks still going on, of course, between Ukraine and Russia",It has to be on his terms,conflict
It may fall away because Ukraine maybe asked to do things it is not prepared to do the Russians may say this is too risky and they'll bring arms in and it may fall away,"that would be, I think, in his interests and clearly, it would be in the Ukrainian president's interest to try and get all those vulnerable people out who would like to leave, who are desperate to leave",conflict

Vladimir Putin explained this is one of the reasons he's invading Ukraine Is there anyone on the panel who thinks that's legitimate and we might not be in the situation we're in now had that not taken place,I might stay with the issue of visas for a moment,conflict
"I might stay with the issue of visas for a moment isn't it ironic that we've got people in need, yeah, because of the war, who are having barriers put in front of them to come to this country","if they go to France, they can get in a dinghy and get free entry",conflict
This isn't just Ukraine other war-torn countries this happens repeatedly,we repeatedly debate this,conflict
"It falls on the wrong side of that line During the middle of the pandemic, in a heartbeat, a VIP hot line was set up for their mates to get contracts out","in a crisis now, they can't find some way of getting a VIP hot line for the people who actually want to come to this country and get protection and during an emergency in their time of need",conflict

"But the week after that the Conservatives are imposing a national income, a national insurance tax hike that will clobber the average family by over an extra £1,000 a year",The only major economy incidentally in the world that is imposing taxes at a time like this,conflict
people are not going to make it through that That's going to be a crisis,"Long term though, after this immediate crisis we have got to stop living in this country on a day-to-day, week-by-week, coping with the latest crisis",conflict
we need a smooth transition We need as much as possible from the renewables,we are going to need gas for a while as that transition happens,conflict
Short term people are really hurting right now I've genuinely got constituents who cannot afford to put food on the table,I started off by saying we should help them,conflict

I recognise many of the struggles that families in my constituency are facing with the surge in prices the energy price cap,when that goes up after tomorrow we will still have significantly lower energy prices than many other European countries,conflict

I don't think it's too little too late it's a good long-term energy strategy in some ways,what's going to happen in the short-term,conflict
I remember when people were insisting we had to move away from nuclear power nuclear power wasn't seen to be safe,We're now apparently getting a nuclear power station every year,conflict
it comes in this October these are the important things that we've announced to help people with bills,"that's different to the long-term strategy that we've launched today with renewables, nuclear, and making sure we're not increasing our imports of oil and gas",conflict

I've not met Rishi Sunak's wife her statement explains she is an Indian national,It's got nothing to do with it,conflict
"It's impossible, according to her statement, that she could become a British national Which means, according to her statement, she is inevitably going to be a non-dom","it's just such nonsense, honestly",conflict
That's why the non-dom rules are there this government has tightened the non-dom rules very considerably,not enough,conflict
"They're the ones who have to carry the burden there are far too many people, I think, who just take the mickey",she's not taking the mickey,conflict
we should change the law so that we have a fairer tax system there is clear evidence that Rishi Sunak is out of touch,not because of his wife's tax arrangements,conflict

it was a blunt instrument unless you have a tracing and testing strategy The government was actually doing community testing but it stopped doing that on 12th of March,Originally it was said that it was a policy decision,rephrase

The issue of testing and tracing of the lockdown was absolutely essential it was a blunt instrument unless you have a tracing and testing strategy,that needs to be ready again and it needs to be attached to a proper tracing strategy and that really has to be a focus now for the government in the weeks ahead,rephrase
If the app is going to work there are two or three things that need to happen it needs to be linked to the right track and tracing resource,"if, for example, you have been in close contact with somebody, you will want to get a test very, very quickly",rephrase

He has been trying to make in-roads into the east we've done absolutely nothing about it,the West has given up trying to do anything about it,rephrase
we've done absolutely nothing about it the West has given up trying to do anything about it,this goes back to 2010 when there was a big Defence Review,rephrase
the problem is that nobody obviously wants the nuclear fall-out that comes with it this is exactly why NATO are wading in now and saying we have to have a no-fly zone,they're concerned that it will be turned into a nuclear war,rephrase
You could have a humanitarian corridor It looks like there is a hint this is an area where both could agree on something,They say they'll need more talks to talk about how it would happen,rephrase
"I have family in Ukraine who are being bombarded and who are fleeing for their lives when I speak to them, they say how grateful they are to people in Britain for everything that you're doing and for the moral support that your country is providing",thank you on behalf of everybody there,rephrase
"there will be other things that we will look to do as the situation progresses We have been, for many years, training and providing equipment to Ukrainian armed forces",I led one of the early training missions to do that,rephrase
"Ukraine will pay the price It is terrible when you hear members of NATO say, ""We're not going to go in and fight""","It is a very unusual thing for nations to do, to take the threat of armed forces off the table as NATO has done",rephrase
"even people who are supposed to be really called this man called Sergey Naryshkin who is his foreign spy chief, he stuttered and looked shocked",didn't look like he was getting his answer right,rephrase
"Inside Russia, and inside Moscow, people close to him, not everyone may think it is a good idea I would never have believed it",I never thought I would see Russians invading Ukraine,rephrase
I would never have believed it I never thought I would see Russians invading Ukraine,"I never thought I'd see an international boycott, driven not just by governments and organisations, but by ordinary people",rephrase
"Inside Russia, and inside Moscow, people close to him, not everyone may think it is a good idea I would never have believed it","It happened so, so fast and spread so quickly",rephrase
"he thought there should still be negotiations Today, they're parading on television",they've got their message in a row,rephrase
"Today, they're parading on television they've got their message in a row",they're lining up behind the Russian president,rephrase
To come back to There is a lot we can do Not everyone doesn't want war,There is one person who does want war,rephrase
Not everyone doesn't want war There is one person who does want war,that is Putin,rephrase
"that is Putin He has had many opportunities to negotiate, bilaterally, multi-laterally",there are institutions in the world from the UN downwards that there are that arbitrate such issues,rephrase
The only way for us to get to the negotiating table is for the Ukrainians to put up a fight that's strong enough that Putin wants to come to the negotiating table there are ways to make sure that everybody wins at that negotiation,this is what I have been warning people in the west about,rephrase
this is exisstential for him There is no way back into the international community,there is no way back for Russia to be welcomed,rephrase
"we're leading him into a dark path At the end of the day, this will end in a negotiation",that's unpleasant for people to hear,rephrase
"we're leading him into a dark path At the end of the day, this will end in a negotiation",The only way for us to get to the negotiating table is for the Ukrainians to put up a fight that's strong enough that Putin wants to come to the negotiating table,rephrase
"often at the risk of being arrested the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill is still being promoted by the Government",which would make those same peaceful protests illegal in this country,rephrase
we need to be honest understand that everybody has security concerns,we have to listen to each other,rephrase
we are now where we are we need to be honest,understand that everybody has security concerns,rephrase
I do worry sometimes that we're not listening to potentially their security concerns For a long time we have been saying that Putin is going to invade Ukraine,it almost became a fait accompli,rephrase
there are messages getting through there are young Russian soldiers who either give themselves up or are captured,you've probably seen on social media,rephrase
"they've had their phones taken away when they're in the Russian military and they can phone home When I listen to the mother, what the parent is hearing from those soldiers, they are bewildered and wary","they're wondering if this is Ukrainian propaganda, a sort of stitch-up",rephrase
"You interviewed Putin twice What else do you think could be done other than the information war, so to speak, that could deter him, change his mind",Change course,rephrase
We're clutching at straws here in the face of the bombardment of these Ukrainian towns and cities and that long column outside Kyiv we don't know what it is going to do,whether there is some massive onslaught coming,rephrase
"When I listen to the mother, what the parent is hearing from those soldiers, they are bewildered and wary they're wondering if this is Ukrainian propaganda, a sort of stitch-up",you can understand that when they're being told this is being fabricated,rephrase
there are messages getting through there are young Russian soldiers who either give themselves up or are captured,"they're given cups of tea and a pancake and asked, ""Do you want to phone your mum""",rephrase
Change course We're clutching at straws here in the face of the bombardment of these Ukrainian towns and cities and that long column outside Kyiv,there are straws,rephrase
"It has to be on his terms the best case scenario would be, the war stopping at Ukraine",Some sort of peace or something,rephrase
"It has to be on his terms the best case scenario would be, the war stopping at Ukraine",Some sort of talking to Putin,rephrase
"Some sort of talking to Putin If that doesn't happen, if the war escalates from Ukraine, what are we going to do next",do we have a Plan B,rephrase
do we have a Plan B Are we at risk at looking back on this in time and thinking that we're just a bystander,"if we let this happen, just purely as a bystander, we have seen in history what that can lead to",rephrase
None of that is going to happen We have to deal with the real politic of this,the real politic is Ukrainians are going to have to put up a fight,rephrase
We have to deal with the real politic of this the real politic is Ukrainians are going to have to put up a fight,they're going to have to get to the negotiating table,rephrase
the real politic is Ukrainians are going to have to put up a fight they're going to have to get to the negotiating table,they're going to have to give away things that they don't care about which is Crimea and the two eastern regions,rephrase
"We in the West are going to have to put not promises, but actual things in place that will ensure Ukraine's long-term security so that country cannot be invaded again",More pieces cannot be bitting off it,rephrase
It is not going to happen None of that is going to happen,I agree with what Konstantin Kisin said,rephrase
it is obvious what Mr Putin wants He has been sabre-rattling for the last couple of decades,the West has just let him get away with it,rephrase
"the Russians may say this is too risky and they'll bring arms in and it may fall away that would be, I think, in his interests and clearly, it would be in the Ukrainian president's interest to try and get all those vulnerable people out who would like to leave, who are desperate to leave",There's that human angle that Bridget talked about,rephrase
"that's something that people are very, very concerned with and understandably so we certainly could do a great deal more there than we are doing at the moment",I hope that the UK government will move its position in terms of refugees,rephrase
I hope that the UK government will move its position in terms of refugees we can do better,we must do better,rephrase
we need to do everything possible to make sure less people suffer I know my country's history,"It has been really, really hard",rephrase
I know it is scary when you hear about nuclear weapons being talked about on the television We have had the nuclear deterrent for 50 years and it has kept us safe,The threats that are being talked about now are the same that we have endured over those last 50 years,rephrase
"That's the scale of cutbacks we've had and still there are 7,000 more soldiers to go",to be cut from today forward by this Government,rephrase
"we have to understand the impact of 12 years a Tory Government has had on our armed services We have fewer ships, fewer sailors and fewer soldiers than this country has had for 300 years",That's the scale of cutbacks we've had,rephrase
no message we send here is going to change that This is about the situation on the ground in Ukraine that has to be dealt with,It is nothing to do with what we say here on this panel,rephrase
Do you think in terms of oligarchs and sanctions against them or not He has been demanding this for years,He has been arguing to get them sent back to Russia,rephrase
This won't change anything We may start to see some figures who sat on the fence and they moved their family to Britain and a lot of their personal wealth and they bought nice houses in Weybridge,they still done business in Russia and gone along to the big Kremlin meetings with Mr Putin that happened recently,rephrase
they still done business in Russia and gone along to the big Kremlin meetings with Mr Putin that happened recently They're going to have to make a choice,Some are on the sanctions list,rephrase
"He's a dangerous and terrible man who is, you know, bringing the worst kind of destruction to the people of Ukraine",we can all see,rephrase
"who is, you know, bringing the worst kind of destruction to the people of Ukraine we can all see",that's the thing with modern day communications. We can see with our own eyes,rephrase
what more can be done to deter him Some of the things that are happening need to be amplified and moved on faster,there needs to be significantly more movement there,rephrase
"there needs to be significantly more movement there We need to make it as uncomfortable as possible for the people who are at the top, the people who are propping Putin up","whatever else we do, we should not be giving them and him an easy ride",rephrase
the reason they support what's happening is the reason what they're told on their television screens the UK government has denied to accept refugees from the Ukraine,Is that true,rephrase
they don't have the freedoms This is government in action,It is democracy in action,rephrase
This is government in action It is democracy in action,"Agree, disagree, we can speak in public",rephrase
I would be locked up for it This is a strength,not a weakness,rephrase
"not a weakness The point you're making, it is about Tory cuts",it is nonsense,rephrase
We heard that we need to send a message to the people in Russia that bla-bla-bla People in Russia don't watch BBC Question Time,They watch Russian national television,rephrase
People in Russia don't watch BBC Question Time They watch Russian national television,That's how most Russians get their news,rephrase
"messages will get through when people don't think what they're hearing on the state media quite adds up, they will look for other sources of information",people will talk to each other,rephrase
"when people don't think what they're hearing on the state media quite adds up, they will look for other sources of information people will talk to each other",They'll swap notes,rephrase
Hopefully that will have an impact the British Government has commended Russians who are peacefully protesting in Moscow,often at the risk of being arrested,rephrase
I'm afraid everyone on the panel is refusing to give you an honest answer the truth is there is nothing we can do,there isn't anything else we can do for Ukraine,rephrase
Don't mistake NATO's red lines to the point of being a bystander We're doing a huge amount,we haven't just been doing this recently,rephrase
We're doing a huge amount we haven't just been doing this recently,we've been doing it for years,rephrase
we haven't just been doing this recently we've been doing it for years,We've been supplying weapons,rephrase
Don't mistake NATO's red lines to the point of being a bystander We're doing a huge amount,we're training Ukrainian armed forces,rephrase
Have we effectively degraded our military to an extent that we're not a significant power any longer What's our Plan B,in terms of a Plan B,rephrase
you look at everything I've said in the House of Commons I've always argued for strong defence spending,we should be doing that,rephrase
It is not the way a civilised country should aspire to deal with people who are fleeing war and terror there is a great deal that needs to be done as part of that,"in Scotland, we're ready to do that",rephrase
"in Scotland, we're ready to do that We're open to refugees and we welcome them coming",We would support people to come here,rephrase
Do you think that UK visa rules should be lifted all to go for Ukrainians We should have a policy,We need to have a policy,rephrase
I'm suggesting we have a system that gives emergency protection to everyone who needs it to come here I've worked in situations like this,I was an aid worker in the Balkans,rephrase
You've got people coming across the border into Ukraine I'm suggesting we have a system that gives emergency protection to everyone who needs it to come here,We need to have a policy,rephrase
You don't insist they have friends and family and they prove they have friends and family So someone crosses the border and comes into Poland and at that point there would be a check,That's what you're suggesting,rephrase
So someone crosses the border and comes into Poland and at that point there would be a check That's what you're suggesting,"There could be a check, to check out who they are and make sure where they're settling so we'd make sure who is coming in and any support needs that people have when they come here",rephrase
"You can have a system whereby, Ukraine, for example, everyone there, you have biometric ID systems, passports are biometric This could be done in a heartbeat",It is swift,rephrase
It is swift What you can't have is what we have at the moment where you have at the minister immigration saying you can come here if you work in our fields doing manual labour,That is one of the routes that the Government are promoting at the moment,rephrase
There has been a lot in the media the last couple of weeks about people in the 1990s like George Kennan warning about NATO expanding eastwards Vladimir Putin explained this is one of the reasons he's invading Ukraine,Is there anyone on the panel who thinks that's legitimate and we might not be in the situation we're in now had that not taken place,rephrase
No for the reasons people set out,What is happening for people to cross that border into safety is very different from them moving on to another nation,rephrase
for the reasons people set out What is happening for people to cross that border into safety is very different from them moving on to another nation,what is actually happening is very responsive to people's needs as they cross that border,rephrase
"what is actually happening is very responsive to people's needs as they cross that border in Kyiv, there has been an operation there to get visas for people already in operation and that's moved to another city further west","it is still going on in Ukraine, our staff are still there processing that",rephrase
What is happening for people to cross that border into safety is very different from them moving on to another nation what is actually happening is very responsive to people's needs as they cross that border,"in Kyiv, there has been an operation there to get visas for people already in operation and that's moved to another city further west",rephrase
"NATO cannot provide any more support than what we're doing we can supply ammunition and weapons and, but this is a fight the Ukrainians have to win",The only way for us to get to the negotiating table is for the Ukrainians to put up a fight that's strong enough that Putin wants to come to the negotiating table,rephrase
"NATO cannot provide any more support than what we're doing we can supply ammunition and weapons and, but this is a fight the Ukrainians have to win",we can provide support to Ukraine,rephrase
Ukraine gave up its nuclear deterrent on a whim We gave it all up,don't pontificate about giving up the nuclear deterrent when they did it,rephrase
"the Ukrainian nation has to have not guarantees, but actual protection from further aggression we're going to have a very difficult conversation about that",NATO and the United States in particular,rephrase
He's saying them now and we have the nuclear weapons in the UK It is a really serious point actually,it is a valid question to ask,rephrase
"there are people around him who would not, you know, be averse to stepping in the prospect of any country having weapons of mass destruction is perhaps one that we should reflect on and think again about",Certainly in Scotland there is a significant body of support for us not to have nuclear weapons,rephrase
we can be generous and provide finance and other things in place to support people locally not every Ukrainian wants to come to the UK,A lot of them would love to come back to Ukraine,rephrase
A lot of them would love to come back to Ukraine We need to have a calibrated response,Just saying we must throw the borders open to anyone who wants to come isn't going to solve the problem,rephrase
you will create problems you'll disrupt the fabric of this society,people have made that point,rephrase
the Polish people have been incredibly generous we can be generous and provide finance and other things in place to support people locally,There is a way to deal with this locally as that will be better for the people who we're talking about,rephrase
people have made that point We've got to make sure that we provide everything we possibly can to people who need it,it does not necessarily have to be done by bringing people here in huge numbers,rephrase
I'm perplexed by what Penny is saying That's not the reality that people are facing and people who are fleeing from this terrible war which we have all seen played out before our eyes are in the most desperate situation,They shouldn't face any barriers going to safety or to coming and being in a place of safety,rephrase
We should be open to that We need to do the right thing and don't rely on other countries to take up the slack,It is important that we step up here and we take our place doing the right thing and supporting the people that are fleeing,rephrase
I was working in a refugee camp what everybody wanted was a TV,They wanted a TV,rephrase
"for the first time in way over a generation, we're actually -- we can see the circumstances whereby it is a possibility That is something that should really give us all pause for thought","the circumstances now, compared to the Cold War, are very, very different",rephrase
Putin is not acting in any rational way that we can judge his behaviour by It is going to require a degree of statescraft on behalf of our country,collectively on behalf of our us and our partners,rephrase
It is going to require a degree of statescraft on behalf of our country collectively on behalf of our us and our partners,particularly NATO,rephrase
they're losing their homes This isn't just Ukraine,other war-torn countries this happens repeatedly,rephrase
We've got a government that doesn't know the difference between tough and nasty too often it falls on the wrong side,It falls on the wrong side of that line,rephrase
I was about to say I agreed with Peter until he made that comment I broadly agree with him in terms of the visa,of the situation,rephrase
I don't want to give people the impression that they can't come across the border and get the assistance that they need I understand there is two schemes,One where there needs to be a family link and one where you need to be sponsored by a business or charity,rephrase
This is not what is happening I don't want to give people the impression that they can't come across the border and get the assistance that they need,but I don't want people to take away a message that people can't do that,rephrase
We are going to do our bit That is our history,"That is our recent history with Afghanistan, with Hong Kong",rephrase
I understand there is two schemes One where there needs to be a family link and one where you need to be sponsored by a business or charity,"You need to be sponsored by a business, individual or charity",rephrase
"We have to recalibrate It is right that NATO, with the help of Britain and Britain playing a leading role is moving forces to reinforce the new boundaries",the new borders that are being drawn in Europe,rephrase
"In a world why Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have nuclear weapons, it is absurd If we didn't have nuclear weapons, where would the troops be today",The only reason they're still in Ukraine and not in Poland is that we have nuclear weapons,rephrase
maybe he would press the button there would be people around him who would think he's crazy,there will be people who will try to stop him,rephrase
"Whether they're successful is a different question In Russia, human life has a different value than in the West",The rational for making these decisions is different,rephrase
What do you mean by that The Russian attitude to human life is that it is less valuable,Individuals are less sacrosanct,rephrase
"of course, he will use nuclear weapons If he thought the war wasn't going his way",NATO got involved,rephrase
If you look at the history of Russia I was interviewing a British historian about this today,"He made the point if you go to the memorial to Soviet soldiers in Berlin, these are people who defeated Nazis and they are great heroes and they're buried in mass graves",rephrase
"He made the point if you go to the memorial to Soviet soldiers in Berlin, these are people who defeated Nazis and they are great heroes and they're buried in mass graves They didn't have the dignity of being buried in their own grave",That's the attitude,rephrase
They didn't have the dignity of being buried in their own grave That's the attitude,That's how it has always been,rephrase
That's how it has always been This is one of the things people in the West don't understand,people in that part of the world have a very different moral framework for making these decisions,rephrase
"people in that part of the world have a very different moral framework for making these decisions using nuclear weapons is also a self-destruct button, isn't it",The question was if pushed,rephrase
"The question was if pushed What you're saying, leaders in Russia have been cavalier",if they're thinking about their own survival,rephrase
Quite Does Putin's high alert order make an attack likely,Is there a chain of command,rephrase
Does Putin's high alert order make an attack likely Is there a chain of command,do the Russians have rules for nuclear launches,rephrase
Is there a chain of command do the Russians have rules for nuclear launches,Does anyone on the panel know the answer to that question,rephrase
do the Russians have rules for nuclear launches Does anyone on the panel know the answer to that question,"As former Defence Secretary, what can you tell us",rephrase
It has seen us through some very difficult times We use it every single hour of every single day,we have done for the last 50 years,rephrase
Putin is sabre-rattling it underlines why nuclear weapons have no place,certainly down my road,rephrase
it underlines why nuclear weapons have no place certainly down my road,not down your road either,rephrase
Putin is sabre-rattling it underlines why nuclear weapons have no place,There is no place for nuclear weapons in the world,rephrase
It works It has seen us through some very difficult times,We use it every single hour of every single day,rephrase
people will be worried about this when they hear it on the news My message would be not to be afraid,my message to you is don't be afraid,rephrase
we've all got to know Ukrainians quite well through our television screens in the last week or so don't we admire them,we would be lucky to have those actually,rephrase
we can benefit out of it We have NHS crisis,We have so many jobs on the list,rephrase
We have NHS crisis We have so many jobs on the list,We can support,rephrase
We can support I come in here and I have no English,"I have a little bit, but not",rephrase
work and I can build my future what's the Government's plan once the Ukrainians do come,What's the Government plans to re-house them and reintegrate them into society,rephrase
What's the Government plans to re-house them and reintegrate them into society We have the Afghan refugee system,There are systems in place to sort out housing through local authorities,rephrase
"what the Chancellor, what the Prime Minister could do immediately is certainly to offer help to people on the lowest incomes all of us are going to be facing these price rises going up","We're all going to be horrified when our council tax, our energy bills, not just tomorrow, but in October as well, goes sky high",rephrase
"what the Chancellor, what the Prime Minister could do immediately is certainly to offer help to people on the lowest incomes there are millions of families that don't have that option",They simply do not have the money,rephrase
People cannot afford that at a time like this This is the wrong time,It's the wrong tax at the wrong time,rephrase
"Rishi Sunak gave like a mini budget statement just a week ago the difference that's going to make to people's household incomes, it's going to take an extra £2,600 in total away from people",People cannot afford that at a time like this,rephrase
that are making something like in excess of £3bn surplus profits That's profits in excess of what they had planned to be making,It wasn't earmarked for investment,rephrase
That's profits in excess of what they had planned to be making It wasn't earmarked for investment,This is money they didn't expect to be getting,rephrase
Something the Government could do immediately to answer your question is impose a windfall tax on the energy companies that are making something like in excess of £3bn surplus profits,A windfall tax on that could take that money and subsidise household incomes at this crucial moment for family finances,rephrase
that are making something like in excess of £3bn surplus profits A windfall tax on that could take that money and subsidise household incomes at this crucial moment for family finances,up to £600 off your bill for the most vulnerable families,rephrase
up to £600 off your bill for the most vulnerable families That would be far more effective than the £200 loan,that the Wonga Chancellor is making everybody take out and then pay back whether you want it or not,rephrase
there was nothing that we heard in the spring statement to actually help those people at this moment in time They haven't got the means to do it,They haven't got savings,rephrase
They haven't got savings there needs to be help,"whether that is just a cut on the tax for people in that circumstance or whether it's extra benefits or it's extra help, just one off payments, something needs to be done",rephrase
these companies need to invest Part of the reason we're in this problem is that we've seen the collapse in investment right now,one of the reasons energy prices have soared is that we haven't been investing enough in energy,rephrase
"we need a smooth transition We need more investment in renewables, more renewables investment in infrastructure, batteries",all of the things that we need as part of that transition,rephrase
We need as much as possible from the renewables we are going to need gas for a while as that transition happens,For decades,rephrase
this Christmas we went out and fed 30 families their Christmas dinner This is children that are suffering and not having food,"More and more professional people, nurses, doctors, professional people are using food banks",rephrase
it's time for change People need help now,"Not in the future, they need it now, right now",rephrase
It means actually planning for the future We need energy,"Crucially, more than anything else, we need energy that is affordable, that is reliable and that is secure",rephrase
"We have got to start planning for the future yes, that means building nuclear power stations",it means fracking for the gas under our feet,rephrase
"yes, that means building nuclear power stations it means fracking for the gas under our feet",It means actually planning for the future,rephrase
"We need energy Crucially, more than anything else, we need energy that is affordable, that is reliable and that is secure",we need to have all of those three things,rephrase
it's only £600 the Shadow Chancellor have confirmed this morning that's only for a third of households,it's not for every household,rephrase
it's only £600 the Shadow Chancellor have confirmed this morning that's only for a third of households,The national insurance threshold will improve the outlook for 70% of households,rephrase
Can I come back to Steve's point about this £600 windfall fax Labour are naive,Labour are naive if they think energy companies won't then pass that tax onto their customers,rephrase
"Labour are naive if they think energy companies won't then pass that tax onto their customers those energy companies, if we want to invest in our energy for the future, will need that money to invest",whether it's in renewables or whether it's in fossil fuels in the short term,rephrase
Why do you think the Chancellor didn't increase benefits he has increased the universal credit taper,He did that before the spring statement,rephrase
it's a foolish tax to introduce Why do you think the Chancellor didn't increase benefits,Benefits will go up by three per cent,rephrase
"it's about £1,000 a year difference But you know what inflation is now, I mean it's over six per cent","By the end of the year inflation could be nine per cent, ten per cent",rephrase
that £600 would make a world of difference to them for the longer term we should be investing in renewables,"Wind, wave power, retrofitting our homes",rephrase
most people haven't lived through the kind of inflation that we're seeing unless you were around in the 1970s as some of us were you're talking about the price cap coming off tomorrow,You're talking about people on average seeing a £700 increase in their energy costs tomorrow,rephrase
"You're talking about people on average seeing a £700 increase in their energy costs tomorrow You're talking about if you live off grid, which many people do in the North of Scotland for example",They buy heating oil,rephrase
They buy heating oil I checked the price tonight,The price has gone up from 44p a litre a year ago to £1.18,rephrase
"So, so much we could do to really get our sustainability levels up This is a massive crisis",most people haven't lived through the kind of inflation that we're seeing unless you were around in the 1970s as some of us were,rephrase
"for the longer term we should be investing in renewables Wind, wave power, retrofitting our homes","So, so much we could do to really get our sustainability levels up",rephrase
I recognise many of the struggles that families in my constituency are facing with the surge in prices the energy price cap,which has up until now saved households around £700 a year on fuel prices,rephrase
"over £1,000 a year for the lowest paid earners We are altering the universal credit taper","which will again bring in around £1,000 a year for the lowest paid households",rephrase
"which will again bring in around £1,000 a year for the lowest paid households We have lifted the national insurance threshold",that will improve the income for about 70% of households by about £300 a year,rephrase
But really not that much And that's been weighted disproportionately to higher income people,and he's not doing very much for those at the bottom,rephrase
We have 25 per cent of Scotland's wind capacity off the Scottish shores. We had demand for about 25Gw We could increase over the next 25 years our green energy in Scotland about fivefold from where we currently are. We can fill that gap,We can make sure that we can deliver safe and cheaply the green energy that we need,rephrase
"No, we're not in a crisis right now in terms of…on that aspect of things you're part of the problem, madam",this move towards net zero in a randomly plucked date in 2050,rephrase
"you're part of the problem, madam this move towards net zero in a randomly plucked date in 2050",which by the way was decided by Parliament after a 90 minute debate,rephrase
this move towards net zero in a randomly plucked date in 2050 which by the way was decided by Parliament after a 90 minute debate,I've spent longer choosing socks than that,rephrase
this move towards net zero in a randomly plucked date in 2050 It's not about a date,It's about a reduction in global atmospheric carbon emissions to reduce a global temperature rise,rephrase
we need to move as fast as possible to a renewables led future in the best possible outcome we are going to need fossil fuels for that transition,We're going to need particularly natural gas,rephrase
We're going to need particularly natural gas which is a fuel,which is an important transition fuel,rephrase
"we've been very united on that across NATO in terms of what's been said about supporting Ukraine, absolutely",we absolutely will be standing with Ukraine and we'll see what happens,rephrase
we can't necessarily take Putin at his word it's around actions that he needs to be judged,actions speak louder than works,rephrase
"it means that Ukraine has agency what's just stunning when you're there is how this entire country has come together, led by the president","it's all of the people in the country determined, absolutely determined to face this invasion",rephrase

"To finish up, it's interesting you spoke about paracetamol's and ibu profen how they have side effects I tend to go to natural remedies","actually as an individual, when I am going through pain, I tend not to if to those things",inference
The Conservative Party suspects the reason why it has the majority is Boris Johnson they are worried if they get rid of him they will get hid of the one thing -- rid of the one thing that got them the election,They move against Boris Johnson at their risk,inference
The issue is not the irreparable damage to the Conservative Party but to the country he is an absolute consistent liar,He wasn't fit to lead the country before we went into the pandemic,inference
"The issue is not the irreparable damage to the Conservative Party but to the country We have to remember his track record of homophobia, racism, sexism, misogyny",He wasn't fit to lead the country before we went into the pandemic,inference
He wasn't fit to lead the country before we went into the pandemic He doesn't care about us,There's absolutely no way he should stay,inference
There's absolutely no way he should stay missed five Cobra meetings,He doesn't care about us,inference
"That means that the questions percolate out there it means people are again, likely to stay away from having vaccines","Until we start discussing this openly, I think the situation is going to continue as it is",inference
That's a transformation the consequence of that is more likely to be resistance than people going along with it,"in general in life, as far as you can, you should reason and argue and debate with people rather than imposing something on them",inference
If I measured yours today and said it was below a protective threshold would that persuade you to get vaccinated It could,I wanted to do it,inference
"I can tell you all the evidence shows is completely safe your risk from the vaccine, and the risk from the vaccine is so low to you, and the benefits are so high that it would boost your immune response","give you the security that those vulnerable members of your family who you have persuaded to get vaccines for very real reasons, you are not going to be passing on the virus to them",inference
That's what is important here It's more important than that,I just worry about it turning into a kind of game,inference
"I just worry about it turning into a kind of game It's about whether we have leadership which has a set of values and has a moral compass that can actually be an example to me, you and our children, and young people who want to enter politics",It's more important than that,inference
"the issue is for me, that integrity matters We have had Prime Ministers who have been paragons of morality like Theresa May and she was rubbish at the job",One shouldn't have to say integrity is important in public life,inference
many of the issues we talked about tonight relate to trust the current situation it's only made it a lot harder to communicate the core messages that people need to hear,Who do you trust in terms to give you a truthful picture of the situation,inference
we are at is the question of compulsory vaccination within the NHS and previously with compulsory vaccination in the care sector given the evidence that was available to ministers making that decision,they made the right decision about the care sector,inference
Given what Robin has said has that not given any difference to your thinking It's not the same for everybody person,You should try and explore that for people who just choose not to,inference
It's not the same for everybody person You should try and explore that for people who just choose not to,maybe that might be a solution to your NHS crisis,inference
so many put in questions about this His current Chief of Staff has just resigned,"There have been four or five resignations today, this evening",inference
"what is sitting behind that is the Prime Minister's former Chief of Staff who has then sitting there, leeching out bit by bit information into the media We are seeing the media then cheerfully picking all this up",the stories are then coming out bit by bit,inference
We are seeing the media then cheerfully picking all this up the stories are then coming out bit by bit,You have to ask yourself whether or not we are being played here,inference
You have to ask yourself whether or not we are being played here we are,we should understand the circumstances,inference
we should understand the circumstances understandably extremely cross,none of that means that we shouldn't be conscious about the affect it has on people who have very properly followed the rules very precisely,inference
If you look at the levels of mortality we have in this country but there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates,I do think when I talk to my public health colleagues what they say to me is be very careful about making international comparisons at this point,inference
"I do think when I talk to my public health colleagues what they say to me is be very careful about making international comparisons at this point For example, there is not a single universal way of recording Coronavirus and none Coronavirus",but there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates,inference
What I would like to see is some honesty from the government acknowledging that this situation was not well handled mistakes have been made,telling us clearly and transparently what they intend to do differently,inference
telling us clearly and transparently what they intend to do differently we have not got a grip on this,"we are experiencing, the number of people dying, the heart breaking scenarios of people dying alone often in unnecessary circumstances",inference
the government's rhetoric is only losing further trust trust is quite important now,Until the government shows some integrity we can't begin to see how we can move forward,inference
there are conclusions to be drawn the Coronavirus,I remember in February two local schools where I live in South London were closed,inference
"it is dangerous and that's certainly what our public health expert colleagues say to draw conclusions at this point clearly we are at 30,000 deaths",It is a real issue,inference
That's something the government have been very keen to say we have the highest death toll in Europe or the second or the third,we are the worst in Europe,inference
"George, apparent success.  Is that how you describe it people who have stayed at home, observed social distancing, our fabulous NHS and everybody who responded to this crisis",the Prime Minister was describing there is what we have all done as a country,inference
That is all to save lives and decrease terrible death toll It is right to acknowledge the steps people have taken,that's what the Prime Minister was doing,inference
London is a huge city It is a city with a big public transportation system,That could have had an impact early on,inference
That could have had an impact early on Now we are dealing with this epidemic,here will be a time to reflect and learn lessons at the end of this,inference
There were all sorts of planning meetings that were taking place on this right from January onwards It was occupying all of Matt Hancock's time,So lots and lots of planning and preparation went into responding to this,inference
"So lots and lots of planning and preparation went into responding to this As soon as the advice was we should lockdown, that's exactly what we did",it was the case that the scientific advice was not that we should have locked down earlier than we did,inference
"So it has been piloted, as you said, in the Isle of Wight The idea is people will go on to the app",They will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way,inference
The idea is people will go on to the app They will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way,If their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time,inference
They will enter their phone number and postcode and no other personal details by the way If their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time,that person subsequently shows symptoms and reports those symptoms,inference
If their mobile phone is in contact for a certain length of time that person subsequently shows symptoms and reports those symptoms,those other people who have been in close or regular contact with that person will receive a notification to say that someone who they were in close contact with has reported symptoms,inference
The government has been changing its narrative to fit its results they made us look good,initially we liked the comparisons,inference
they made us look good now they make us look bad,we can't trust them,inference
"This is what I mean by honesty The definition of testing was changed when it emerged that we couldn't meet the 100,000 a day standard we were promised",The government has been changing its narrative to fit its results,inference
It makes us people who are suffering and doing our absolute best in circumstances where we can't help with We deserve an honest acknowledgment of that,You feel the leadership has failed this,inference
it took weeks and weeks after that for the government to then start to actually ramp up testing to the level that it needed to be at I am afraid that hitting the target on 30th of April was done by putting a number of tests in the post without actual guarantee that those tests had been used,it's not got to that yet,inference
"One of the issues is by focusing, as we have done, on purely hitting that 100,000 the government has done hitting that 100,000 target by April 30th",we have not really quite got the geographic spread we need of testing,inference
"the government has done hitting that 100,000 target by April 30th we have not really quite got the geographic spread we need of testing",that will need to be ramped up,inference
Are you confident that will happen the NHS needs to play its part,We need support also from the government,inference
Care home staff can't have tests They have to apply online,They are not getting them in time,inference
The information commissioner was not consulted on this app This potentially fails the NHS app standards for data protection,What assurances can the government give us in the data protection standards,inference
My understanding is once you sign up to the app there is not a lot of data otherwise it won't work,as soon as you develop symptoms of Coronavirus you have to have that data on a database,inference
They should self-isolate initially If they don't have symptoms,they wouldn't need to isolate for longer than that,inference
Testing along with this is an option to work out precisely how this would work,This is why we are piloting it,inference
This is why we are piloting it because it will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms,It could be very powerful,inference
It could be very powerful because it will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms,We will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down,inference
Testing along with this is an option It could be very powerful,This is why we are piloting it,inference
One final point I would just like to make They have already resolved some of these problems,What I am a bit surprised about is we are not learning from countries that are further ahead of this,inference
"there might be a good idea to back another horse, which is the app that's being developed in Korea we have two horses",we can get one of them to work very quickly,inference
we have two horses we need to,we can get one of them to work very quickly,inference
we are in favour of using track and trace the app is very much part of that,We have been arguing a strategy on this for some considerable time now,inference
This is coming really quite quickly At the moment nobody in the NHS knows what role they are meant to be playing to support the app,What we will need is the results of that pilot or trial in the Isle of Wight circulated very quickly,inference
The NHS will need to know very quickly what they are meant to be doing George doesn't seem to be clear how it works,People need to know how it works,inference
The government keeps getting distracted by the wrong things They were too consumed about models and herd immunity,We were talking about why the government didn't have tests in place earlier,inference
We are not entirely clear We are not sure how it is going to work,it is being tried in the Isle of Wight,inference
Two weeks is being suggested This is something that may be coming the way of all of us,Let's understand how it works to be clear,inference
We don't know yet We don't know,This is why we are piloting it in the Isle of Wight,inference
"This is why we are piloting it in the Isle of Wight if people in the Isle of Wight are doing it, they must know what they should do",This must have been worked out,inference
"From the very beginning we have been holding daily press conferences They have been very, very candid about the nature of this crisis, the reasons we are doing the things we are doing, very candid about the evidence and epidemiology behind it",We have been I think as frank as possible with the public,inference
"we had the awful prospect of people turning up to hospitals and simply not being able to be treated the NHS has actually created 33,000 beds to cater to Coronavirus patients",We have created 7 Nightingale Hospitals literally within the space of a fortnight,inference
"They have been very, very candid about the nature of this crisis, the reasons we are doing the things we are doing, very candid about the evidence and epidemiology behind it shared with them all of our thinking",We have been I think as frank as possible with the public,inference
we should be doing more track and tracing is going to be successful,We have to help these tracers to get at least 70 to 90% success rate,inference
"One of the major issues that concerns many viewers that will download the mobile app is our reluctance for the government to access our private data and all the privacy issues of using such data for track, trace and quarantine Then they can track if we have caught the virus to pinpoint where we have been and whom we have had contact with",To be a success it is essential that the authorities have access to our personal data,inference
all these discussions about comparisons and we are not sure with all of its capability,"the data is good enough for us to say that a country like ours, like Britain, with all of its capability we should have done better",inference
Until the government shows some integrity we can't begin to see how we can move forward What you said in your question is we didn't plan ahead,Margaret's question is absolutely spot on,inference
I have not seen any conversation like that happen yet We need this app and to be able to track and trace,we absolutely need this technology,inference
"we absolutely need this technology This has been the strategy in countries that have managed this very successfully, in South Korea, for example",We need this app and to be able to track and trace,inference
there is going to be a set of data It is going to have to be held centrally,you are going to pick up those different parts of the country where there are outbreaks,inference
the app itself is going to be a necessity going forward in order to move out of the lockdown We need to understand the two different apps actually have different ways in which the data is hemmed,we are missing something important here,inference
"talk to those in the south where George's constituency is, they have said they have not experienced that level of demand they were expecting we are missing which feels important to me is one of the things about lockdown which is the consistent lack of national communications",we try to have different areas doing different things at different times,inference
"One of the advantages of the NHS app we have been developing, I think people can trust it as part of the NHS Unlike some of those other apps you get better information about where you might get local flare ups",we are able to respond to that and monitor local or regional pick up in the virus,inference
the privacy issue has to go out the window we have to see this as what it is,We have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we have to see this as what it is we have all made too many sacrifices,We have to use all of the available technology and data to make sure that we can crack this virus and start living again,inference
we have all made too many sacrifices we are trying to get out of lockdown to save the economy and jobs,it is certain you are desperate to get out of the house,inference
Do you think it is appropriate to ease the lockdown in all areas of the county at the same time and in the same way even though the effects of the virus have not been evenly distributed in the north we have seen high death rates in towns like Sunderland,I don't know if these should be managed in the same way as other parts of the country like the Northway,inference
"I sit here in Wales The guidelines, for example, are slightly different",There have been moments in the crisis where Wales have taken slightly different decisions,inference
on the whole the Welsh government has tried to take a four nations approach we do all share these islands,that has been the sensible way to proceed,inference
in my own constituency tier for Torfaen I would in ordinary circumstances have people who commuted to work Different at the moment but in ordinary circumstances they commute over the border,"It gets very difficult if you have things that are very, very different in different parts of the country",inference
"This has not been explained Some of us from the first anecdotal evidence of this, from the beginning have been asking for concerted evidence as to why certain ethnic groups appear to be so much at risk",There is an inquiry,inference
"you absolutely have to have a method of enforcement so that everybody can have confidence, whether it is employers or employees","We have been working for a national safety standard and putting that together with employers, with the employees and of course across political parties",inference
the Prime Minister has already an idea of what he is likely to outline on Sunday is a route map about how we can revolve this policy clearly we are not out of the woods on this by any means,We are going to be very cautious,inference
credit card spending and spending like that We really need to trust the tracers to be able to meet that target to contain this virus of 70% to 90% of the people,we need to give the tracers as much information as possible,inference
You have to report you have symptoms you need a pretty significant take-up to get the information you want from it,Is it really going to be of any use,inference
That's not true Matt Hancock has set up this inquiry,It was taken seriously,inference
"In these circumstances, the Health and Safety Executive have been involved with some of the guidance with food companies All of the agencies have been working and contributing to the guidance that businesses are following",Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency as well,inference
"George, when you hear someone like Charles saying he is apprehensive about going back to work with colleagues less than 20 metres away and hot desking, should someone be able to say without fear of being laid off ""it is not safe enough.  It is not adhering to the best practices.  I am not going to come in"" We want people to feel safe to return to work",That's why the government has been doing a lot of work over the last few weeks with unions and employers,inference
"The food industry I am responsible for Food manufacturers, diaries, meat producers, they have all managed to put in place social distancing measures",People going in April to supermarket see social distancing measures put in place,inference
"These conversations are designed to protect people who work for the worst case scenario businesses people who are vulnerable, who are too insecure to be able to challenge employers at work or depend on zero hours contracts, won't be protected",we need stringent measures that are not optional,inference
"we need stringent measures that are not optional people who are vulnerable, who are too insecure to be able to challenge employers at work or depend on zero hours contracts, won't be protected","We ought to be thinking about the worst case, not best case scenario",inference
That is legally binding That's actually created issues,What we also know is that life is now becoming really complex,inference
indeed a lot of the economy is working today The retail sector is working and some other sectors are working,we learn from those,inference
if they are not we know we don't have a perfect record of safety at work,there are employers who will flout good practice,inference
They need to be binding if they are not,there are employers who will flout good practice,inference
This is where trust comes in If we were in a position where the government had been honest with us and taken all these concerns seriously from the beginning,it would be a lot easier to listen to proposed guidelines about returning to work,inference
You need to have flexibility for employers to do what works in their environment there will always be employers who are not responsible and willing to put their workers at risk,we need a bit of reality,inference
"We are going through complications When we have talked to our staff about what might happen, things they immediately raised were what is it going to be like travelling into the central part of the city and being on a packed tube train and next to people that might present a safety risk",An example is we work in the centre of London,inference
George talks about the food industry because he is responsible for that This is one of the issues the government faces,We also need to ensure transport is appropriately configured,inference
George talks about the food industry because he is responsible for that This is quite an issue if we are going to be able to enable and support people to come back to work,We also need to ensure transport is appropriately configured,inference
I agree with Afua they take it seriously,most employers would do that,inference
they take it seriously The Health and Safety Executive will enforce the few that don't,they don't,inference
We only have 60 people on staff we have a very narrow corridor which effectively enables people to get to and from their desk,Our office is difficult,inference
Our office is difficult we have a very narrow corridor which effectively enables people to get to and from their desk,There is no way we are going to be able to observe social distancing,inference
"you are talking about the people in your office when this comes to ambulance workers, community trust workers, hospital workers you are obviously here as the face of that","Do you think that these protections should be legally binding, as it is being suggested or optional extras, as John is suggesting",inference
what you actually need is leaders who think the welfare of their staff is by far the most important thing you need the ingenuity of staff to help you do things like work out how you would create a system if you have a narrow corridor,certainly that's the way we act as our senior leadership team in our organisation,inference
"they had high levels of people self-isolating due to Coronavirus, 20% What people discovered is once those social distancing measures were put in place.  Staff returned to work",this is down to 4 to 5% which is not much different from normal,inference
We went in it together The messaging wasn't quite clear enough,as we come out we have to be together to help simplify the messaging,inference
you might have to look at that specific area too there have already been variations across the UK,I do accept there will be variations,inference
we just talked about the contact tracing app these lockdown restrictions start to ease and there is a particular area where the tracing app showed that there was a very specific problem,you might have to look at that specific area too,inference
"alongside that we absolutely need an enforcement of these guidelines If that is the case, then we can have confidence going forward that people do feel safe going to work",we really need to make sure is that there are sufficient resources available for that enforcement to take place,inference
You'll have heard the Defence Secretary explain over the last few days why NATO is not going to stand up a no-fly zone which a lot of people are asking for there would be huge risks to doing it,he's outlined why that would be very difficult to do,inference
A no-fly zone would mean no flights could fly in the over Ukraine? But would deny Ukrainian armed forces airspace as well,so there are some very good reasons why they don't want to do that,inference
It is absolutely in our interests as a country to have a free and sovereign Ukraine Putin's ambitions do not stop at Ukraine,Putin's war has to be finished on Ukrainian soil,inference
Ukraine cannot be the price of our own security Putin's ambitions do not stop at Ukraine,It is absolutely in our interests as a country to have a free and sovereign Ukraine,inference
Ukraine will pay the price the Ukrainians are there as sitting ducks,"It is terrible when you hear members of NATO say, ""We're not going to go in and fight""",inference
it is utterly disgraceful that we got to this situation the problem is that nobody obviously wants the nuclear fall-out that comes with it,this is exactly why NATO are wading in now and saying we have to have a no-fly zone,inference
You can't have a no-fly zone then you have World War III,We've got to be sensible,inference
We've got to be sensible It looks like there is a hint this is an area where both could agree on something,You could have a humanitarian corridor,inference
I'm proud to be British Russia has produced great works of music,I'm also proud to be Russian,inference
I'm also proud to be Russian I feel nothing but shame for my country and what it is doing,It is a very difficult moment,inference
I feel nothing but shame for my country and what it is doing I have family in Ukraine who are being bombarded and who are fleeing for their lives,It is a very difficult moment,inference
"It is a very difficult moment when I speak to them, they say how grateful they are to people in Britain for everything that you're doing and for the moral support that your country is providing",I have family in Ukraine who are being bombarded and who are fleeing for their lives,inference
thank you on behalf of everybody there the truth is there is nothing we can do,I'm afraid everyone on the panel is refusing to give you an honest answer,inference
NATO cannot get involved in this because that would start World War III NATO cannot provide any more support than what we're doing,"we can supply ammunition and weapons and, but this is a fight the Ukrainians have to win",inference
Do not slaughter women and children you spent a lot of time in Moscow,I'm particularly interested to hear your prospective,inference
There is a sense that there is dismay beneath the surface in Russia he thought there should still be negotiations,"It didn't seem to be that his Foreign Minister thought this is what should be happening,",inference
He chose to build up his arms and he chose to invade they are going to be scared and they need emergency protection and we should be giving it to them,"The options we have now are to support those incredibly brave Ukrainian fighters, to support them with arms, to support them with aid and to support those people who are forced to flee",inference
this is what I have been warning people in the west about we don't want to back him into a corner,I understand the rhetoric about Vladimir Putin and Russia,inference
I understand the rhetoric about Vladimir Putin and Russia this is exisstential for him,we don't want to back him into a corner,inference
There is no way back into the international community there is no way back for Russia to be welcomed,we're leading him into a dark path,inference
that's unpleasant for people to hear We have to make it clear what the consequences will be if he goes further,I'm not talking about appeasement of any kind,inference
We have to make it clear what the consequences will be if he goes further we can provide support to Ukraine,they're going to have to win this fight themselves,inference
one would hope nobody wants any war they've mentioned red lines and supporting military training and weapons into Ukraine,the rhetoric recently has been very powerful,inference
"understand that everybody has security concerns the more the rhetoric ramps up, the harder it is to get together and reach a deton",we have to listen to each other,inference
they've mentioned red lines and supporting military training and weapons into Ukraine the rhetoric recently has been very powerful,I do worry sometimes that we're not listening to potentially their security concerns,inference
how are we going to do that given that television channels and radio stations have been taken off the air there are messages getting through,It is going to be important,inference
there are young Russian soldiers who either give themselves up or are captured they've had their phones taken away when they're in the Russian military and they can phone home,"they're given cups of tea and a pancake and asked, ""Do you want to phone your mum""",inference
they're going to have to get to the negotiating table Nobody expects to get them back,they're going to have to give away things that they don't care about which is Crimea and the two eastern regions,inference
Nobody expects to get them back so that country cannot be invaded again,"We in the West are going to have to put not promises, but actual things in place that will ensure Ukraine's long-term security",inference
I agree with what Konstantin Kisin said it is obvious what Mr Putin wants,I find it incredulous that you talk about you don't know what Mr Putin wants,inference
I find it incredulous that you talk about you don't know what Mr Putin wants He has been sabre-rattling for the last couple of decades,it is obvious what Mr Putin wants,inference
Nobody expects to get them back that may involve some peace-keeping force on that border,"We in the West are going to have to put not promises, but actual things in place that will ensure Ukraine's long-term security",inference
the Russians may say this is too risky and they'll bring arms in and it may fall away what he's saying is we're not doing that,Mr Putin wants to be seen bombarding Ukrainian cities by his people,inference
we certainly could do a great deal more there than we are doing at the moment we can do better,I hope that the UK government will move its position in terms of refugees,inference
I'm coming from Latvia We're NATO,"we're very, very happy",inference
We're NATO We stepped in the last train basically,"we're very, very happy",inference

"we are really, really proud We have this independence",we're going to do everything that's possible,inference
this is not a likely outcome NATO has been very clear that if you do anything to a NATO member state,it is going to retaliate and it will defend itself,inference
The threats that are being talked about now are the same that we have endured over those last 50 years we have to understand the impact of 12 years a Tory Government has had on our armed services,"We have fewer ships, fewer sailors and fewer soldiers than this country has had for 300 years",inference
"the people in Russia are being told there is a genocide being committed in Ukraine, that NATO is about to invade, that NATO is getting ready to position missiles to strike against the heart of Russia no message we send here is going to change that",This is about the situation on the ground in Ukraine that has to be dealt with,inference
We may start to see some figures who sat on the fence and they moved their family to Britain and a lot of their personal wealth and they bought nice houses in Weybridge they still done business in Russia and gone along to the big Kremlin meetings with Mr Putin that happened recently,They're going to have to make a choice,inference
what more can be done to deter him there are still a number of loopholes in terms of the sanctions that have been put into place,Some of the things that are happening need to be amplified and moved on faster,inference
Some of the things that are happening need to be amplified and moved on faster Some of that is sort of a timing issue,there are still a number of loopholes in terms of the sanctions that have been put into place,inference
there is a generational split the reason they support what's happening is the reason what they're told on their television screens,"My point was the broader public in Russia, 65% to 70% support what's happening",inference
they were instructed not to look This is a government that's had a blind spot,it must end now,inference
There are people in Russia who would love to play party politics they don't have the freedoms,they can't do so,inference

we would be in a worse situation now I just said what I said in Russia,I would be locked up for it,inference
"We live in a social media age when people don't think what they're hearing on the state media quite adds up, they will look for other sources of information",messages will get through,inference
they put some red lines in place in NATO to ensure that the situation is not going to escalate They do not train hard to slaughter women and children,they don't want to do is for any NATO troops or aircraft to come into contact or combat with Russian forces,inference
"there are straws It didn't seem to be that his Foreign Minister thought this is what should be happening,",There is a sense that there is dismay beneath the surface in Russia,inference
there are straws was berated by Mr Putin,There is a sense that there is dismay beneath the surface in Russia,inference
"there are straws When this whole invasion was announced by Mr Putin, he called in his top echelon",There is a sense that there is dismay beneath the surface in Russia,inference
"the more the rhetoric ramps up, the harder it is to get together and reach a deton I lived in this country since 1995",I'm proud to be British,inference
what would happen there We're doing a huge amount,Don't mistake NATO's red lines to the point of being a bystander,inference
we should recognise the return on that investment to the UK there is any good that's come of the last few days,the West is really waking up to this,inference
we need to keep them fighting I've always argued for strong defence spending,you look at everything I've said in the House of Commons,inference
there is a great deal that needs to be done as part of that We're open to refugees and we welcome them coming,"in Scotland, we're ready to do that",inference
We need to have a policy It said that refugees can come in for up to 3 years,The situation is that the EU has waived visa relegations,inference
It said that refugees can come in for up to 3 years it is the UK,you have to apply for a visa,inference
You've got people coming across the border into Ukraine I've worked in situations like this,I'm suggesting we have a system that gives emergency protection to everyone who needs it to come here,inference
